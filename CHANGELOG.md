## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **The WebSocket client transport now sends its configured headers, subprotocols and user agent** (#165). `WebSocketTransport::connect` built the upgrade request from a fixed set of headers and always offered `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: mqtt`, so anything set with `WebSocketConfig::with_header`, `with_subprotocol`, `with_subprotocols` or `with_user_agent` never reached the server, and brokers that authenticate the upgrade request through custom headers rejected the connection. The request now carries every custom header, the configured subprotocols in order, followed by `mqtt` when the list does not include it (MQTT-6.0.0-3), and the user agent when one is set. The default user agent is now `mqtt5/<crate version>` instead of `mqtt-v5/0.4.0`.
- **The upgrade request's `Host` header now includes a non-default port**, so `ws://broker:8080/mqtt` sends `Host: broker:8080` rather than `Host: broker`.

### Changed

- **WebSocket configurations that relied on the old behavior may connect differently or fail to connect.** Because the configuration now reaches the wire:
  - A custom header that is invalid or reserved (see the next entry) used to be silently dropped. It now makes `connect` fail.
  - Every WebSocket connection, including those made by `MqttClient`, now sends a `User-Agent` header.
- **`connect` rejects a WebSocket configuration it cannot send faithfully, before dialing.** It fails with `MqttError::Configuration` in these cases:
  - a custom header has an invalid name or value, or repeats another custom header's name (case-insensitively);
  - a custom header names one reserved for the handshake: `Host`, `Connection`, `Upgrade`, `Sec-WebSocket-Version`, `Sec-WebSocket-Key`, `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` or `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`;
  - a custom header is `Content-Length`, `Transfer-Encoding` or `Trailer`, which would describe a body the upgrade request does not have, or a hop-by-hop or expectation header: `TE`, `Keep-Alive`, `Proxy-Connection` or `Expect`;
  - `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` or `User-Agent` is set as a custom header instead of through its setter;
  - a subprotocol is not a valid HTTP token, or is listed more than once (RFC 6455 §4.1).
- Custom headers are sent, and validated, in name order, so the request and the error a bad configuration reports no longer depend on `HashMap` iteration order.
- `WebSocketConfig`'s `Debug` output lists custom header names but not their values, which often carry credentials.

### Added

- `WebSocketConfig::build_handshake_request`, which returns the upgrade request the configuration produces.

## [mqtt5 0.47.3] - 2026-10-09

### Fixed

- **The QUIC broker decodes MQTT v3.1.1 packets on data streams and in datagrams** (#193). Only the control stream knew the protocol version the client connected with. A v3.1.1 SUBSCRIBE or PUBLISH on a client data stream, or a v3.1.1 PUBLISH in a datagram, was decoded as v5 and rejected, and since 0.47.2 the connection was closed with `ERROR_PROTOCOL_L0`. These readers now wait for CONNECT and decode with the negotiated version.
- **A QUIC client reads short messages on broker-opened streams at once** (#195). The client kept reading a broker-opened stream until it had 32 bytes before parsing the flow header. A flow header and a PUBLISH with no properties can be shorter than that, which is the usual case for a v3.1.1 subscriber, so the message waited until more data arrived on that stream or the connection closed. The client now parses the header as soon as it is complete.
- **A v3.1.1 client can unsubscribe** (#194). It could not decode the broker's UNSUBACK, which in v3.1.1 has no properties or reason codes, so `unsubscribe()` failed with `UNSUBACK channel closed` and the connection dropped. Fixed in mqtt5-protocol 0.16.1.

## [mqtt5-wasm 2.1.6] - 2026-10-09

### Fixed

- **The wasm broker serves MQTT v3.1.1 clients** (#193). It decoded every client packet as v5, so a v3.1.1 client's first SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE or QoS 1 PUBLISH was rejected and its connection dropped. A PUBLISH whose payload started with `0x00` lost that byte. Packets are now decoded with the version the client connected with.
- **The wasm client can unsubscribe over v3.1.1** (#194), through mqtt5-protocol 0.16.1.

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.16.1] - 2026-10-09

### Fixed

- **`Packet::decode_from_body_with_version` decodes a v3.1.1 UNSUBACK** (#194). UNSUBACK was decoded as v5 for every version and a v3.1.1 UNSUBACK, which is only a packet identifier, was rejected as malformed. A v3.1.1 UNSUBACK with any payload is still malformed.

### Added

- `UnsubAckPacket::decode_body_with_version`.

## [mqtt5 0.47.2] - 2026-10-08

### Fixed

- **The broker closes a QUIC connection after a malformed packet on any path** (#192). A malformed packet on the control stream ended the MQTT session but left the QUIC connection open until the idle timeout. On a client data stream only that stream was stopped, with `ERROR_IMCOMPLETE_PACKET` (0xBA), and in a datagram the packet was logged and dropped; in both cases the session carried on. A malformed packet on the control stream, a data stream or in a datagram now closes the connection with `ERROR_PROTOCOL_L0` (0xB4), as a malformed packet closes the socket over TCP. A PUBLISH to a topic name with wildcards gets the same code. Empty datagrams and datagrams whose first byte is 0x00, which MQoQ reserves for non-MQTT payloads, are still ignored. When the control stream ends for any other reason, the broker waits up to one second for the client to close the connection, so a DISCONNECT or CONNACK it has just sent is not discarded, and then closes it with `NO_ERROR` after a normal end or `ERROR_UNSPECIFIED` (0xB2) otherwise. A client that resets or finishes one of its data streams still keeps its session.

## [mqtt5 0.47.1] - 2026-10-08

### Fixed

- **`ClientConnectEvent.clean_start` reports the Clean Start flag the client sent** (#186). It reported whether a stored session was resumed instead, so a client connecting for the first time with Clean Start 0 and a session expiry was reported as `clean_start = true`. Consumers that decide session persistence from the event treated that client as clean. The wasm broker already passed the CONNECT flag. Covered for plain connects and for connects completed through multi-step enhanced authentication.

## [mqtt5 0.47.0] - 2026-10-05

### Breaking

- **Minimum supported Rust version is now 1.89** (was 1.88), for `std::fs::File::try_lock`.
- **A broker refuses to start on a storage directory another broker is using** (#179). Since 0.42.0 all session writes go to one append-only log, `<storage_dir>/sessions/sessions.log`, and nothing stopped two brokers, in one process or in two, from opening the same directory. Both then wrote and compacted the same log, so one broker's compaction could drop sessions the other had written: with two brokers on one directory, a session written through the first broker was gone after a restart. The file backend now takes an exclusive lock on `<storage_dir>/.lock` when it opens the directory and holds it until the backend is dropped, after the last connection handler has finished with storage; the OS releases it if the process exits or crashes. A second broker on the same directory fails in `MqttBroker::with_config` with `Storage directory <dir> is already in use by another broker`. Two `mqttv5 broker` processes started from the same working directory with the default `./mqtt_storage`, or sharing `--storage-dir`, now hit this error instead of sharing the directory. In-memory storage is not affected. On a filesystem where file locking is not supported (`ErrorKind::Unsupported`), the broker logs a warning and starts without the lock, as before.
- **`run_quic_connection_handler` and `run_quic_cluster_connection_handler` take a `QuicHandlerContext`** in place of their seven separate broker arguments.

### Changed

- **Graceful shutdown now waits for connection handlers.** `MqttBroker::run()` used to return while connection handlers were still writing their final session state, so those writes could still be in progress after `run()` returned. `run()` now returns once every connection handler has finished, within the existing 5 second shutdown wait; if that wait runs out it logs a warning and returns. The release point and the wait are modelled in `specs/tla/storage-lock/`.
- Graceful shutdown also waits for the `$SYS` topics task and for the bridge tasks it aborts. With bridges configured, the bridge client's connection monitor still exits a few milliseconds after `run()` returns, so the storage directory is released that much later.
- Integration tests that started brokers on the default `./mqtt_storage` in parallel now use in-memory storage.

### Fixed

- **`MqttClient::disconnect()` now stops the connection monitor at once.** The monitor only checked for a stop once a second, so after `disconnect()` it kept the client, its callbacks and anything they hold alive for up to a second. A broker with a bridge held its storage directory that long after shutdown.

## [mqttv5-cli 0.29.6] - 2026-10-05

### Changed

- Requires mqtt5 0.47. `mqttv5 broker` now refuses to start when another broker holds its storage directory.

## [mqtt5-wasm 2.1.5] - 2026-10-05

### Changed

- Requires mqtt5 0.47. No change to the wasm API; the wasm broker uses in-memory storage and takes no directory lock.

## [mqtt5 0.46.4] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- **Aborting the task running `MqttBroker::run()` now stops the broker** (#177). The accept loops, connection handlers and storage cleanup were detached tasks that only stopped on the graceful-shutdown signal, so aborting or dropping `run()` left the broker serving existing clients and accepting new ones. `run()` now sends that signal when it is dropped, so an abort takes the same path as graceful shutdown. The `$SYS` topics task is stopped with it, and configured bridges are stopped the same way graceful shutdown stops them, disconnecting from the remote broker.

## [mqtt5 0.46.3] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- **A QUIC user-defined flow (type 0x14) opened by the server no longer risks closing the connection** (part of #169). The client did not recognise the 0x14 flow header and parsed the stream as MQTT. When the application data happened to decode as a complete packet, the client treated it as a malformed packet, sent DISCONNECT and closed the whole connection. A user-defined flow carries non-MQTT data (MQoQ §9.20), so the client now refuses it: it stops the stream with ERROR_FLOW_REFUSED (0xBE), resets its send side on a bidirectional stream, and leaves the connection and other flows untouched.

## [mqtt5 0.46.2] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- **QoS 0 messages on a QUIC server unidirectional stream now reach `subscribe_with_ack` callbacks** (part of #169). The client passed messages from server-opened unidirectional streams only to plain `subscribe` callbacks, so a subscription made with `subscribe_with_ack` never saw them. A broker sends QoS 0 on a unidirectional stream when it delivers each publish on its own stream, as the mqtt5 broker does with `ServerDeliveryStrategy::PerPublish`.

## [mqtt5 0.46.1] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- **`ConnectOptions::resume_existing_session` docs overstated delivery across a restart** (part of #168). They said delivery across a restart is at-least-once. That holds for inbound messages, which the broker redelivers. Outbound publishes the previous process had not completed are not resent and may never reach subscribers, so the application has to publish them again. New tests (`qos2_resume_after_restart`) cover this. They also check that the broker still holds the unfinished QoS 2 exchange after the reconnect, and that a new QoS 2 publish reusing its packet identifier replaces it and is delivered.

## [mqtt5 0.46.0] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- **The client's offline queue is now bounded** (part of #168). QoS 1 and 2 publishes made while disconnected were limited only by the packet identifier space (65,535 messages), each holding its full payload, so memory was effectively unbounded. The queue now enforces `ConnectOptions::session_config.max_queued_messages` and `max_queued_size`, which were previously not applied to it. A publish that would exceed either limit fails with `MqttError::OfflineQueueFull` and is not queued; nothing already queued is dropped. Messages put back into the queue on reconnect are never refused, but count toward the limits. The size of a queued message is its encoded PUBLISH packet.
- **New defaults: 1,000 queued messages or 64 MiB.** `max_queued_messages` keeps its default of 1,000. `max_queued_size` goes from 1 MiB to 64 MiB, the same per-client limit the broker uses for its queues. A client that queued more than this while offline will now get `OfflineQueueFull` instead.
- Requires mqtt5-protocol 0.16.

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.16.0] - 2026-10-02

### Breaking

- **`MqttError` is now `#[non_exhaustive]`.** Code that matches on it exhaustively needs a wildcard arm. Future error variants are then no longer a breaking change.

### Added

- `MqttError::OfflineQueueFull { max_messages, max_bytes }`, returned when a publish would exceed the client's offline queue limits.

## [mqttv5-cli 0.29.5] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- Requires mqtt5 0.46.

## [mqtt5-wasm 2.1.4] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- Requires mqtt5 0.46 and mqtt5-protocol 0.16. No change to the wasm API.

## [mqtt5 0.45.3] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- **Publishes queued while offline now go through the codec and carry the trace context** (part of #168). A QoS 1 or 2 publish made while the client was disconnected was queued before the codec registry encoded its payload and before the OpenTelemetry trace context was injected, so after reconnecting it went out uncompressed, without its content type, and without `traceparent`. Queued and live publishes are now built the same way, and the trace context is the one active when `publish()` was called.

## [mqtt5 0.45.2] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- **A cancelled `publish()` no longer keeps a Receive Maximum slot** (part of #168). A QoS 1 or 2 publish takes a send-quota slot before its message is stored as in flight. If the `publish()` future was dropped in between, for example by a timeout or a `select!` while it waited on a lock, the slot was never returned, and with a small Receive Maximum every later QoS 1 or 2 publish waited until the next reconnect. The slot is now returned when the future is dropped before the message is stored.

## [mqtt5 0.45.1] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- **`max_queued_bytes_per_client` now limits the memory a queue actually uses** (#160). A queued message was counted by its payload length alone, so its topic, client id, user properties, content type, response topic, correlation data and the queue entry itself went uncounted, and a queue of small messages could occupy well over its configured byte limit. Each entry is now counted by `QueuedMessage::footprint` plus the queue's per-entry overhead, both when pushed and when reloaded from disk at startup. Queues of small messages now reach the byte limit, and start dropping their oldest entries, sooner than before.

### Added

- `QueuedMessage::footprint`.

## [mqtt5 0.45.0] - 2026-10-01

### Breaking

- **`broker::storage::QueueOp` and `broker::storage::QueueWriter` are no longer public.** They described the file backend's internal write-behind channel, which is gone.

### Fixed

- **The file backend's memory no longer grows with QoS 1/2 throughput** (#158, #159). Every outbound QoS 1/2 delivery stores an inflight row and removes it on acknowledgement, and every queued message is written and later deleted; these went through an unbounded channel to a single writer task, which fell behind under load. A 30-second QoS 1 flood (16 publishers, 8 subscribers, 256-byte payloads) left about 11 million operations in the channel and the broker at 4.6 GB, against 54 MB on the memory backend. Writes and removals now update a shared pending map in place, so a row removed before it reaches the disk cancels its write immediately, and the writer flushes that map every 250 ms or once it holds 8192 rows. Pending state is bounded by the rows that are actually open, so the same flood now holds the broker at 55 MB.

## [mqttv5-cli 0.29.4] - 2026-10-01

### Changed

- Requires mqtt5 0.45.

## [mqtt5-wasm 2.1.3] - 2026-10-01

### Changed

- Requires mqtt5 0.45. No change to the wasm API.

## [mqtt5 0.44.2] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- **Connecting no longer blocks a runtime thread while the broker's hostname is resolved** (#156). `MqttClient::connect` and its variants resolved the address with the blocking `ToSocketAddrs`, so a slow DNS server stalled the tokio worker thread running the connect, and every task scheduled on it. Resolution now uses `tokio::net::lookup_host`. The bridge's TLS connection path had the same blocking lookup and now uses it too.

## [mqttv5-cli 0.29.3] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- `mqttv5 bench` resolves the broker address without blocking the runtime.

## [mqtt5 0.44.1] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed

- **A resumed session no longer receives a new message before the older unacknowledged one it is resuming.** After a broker restart, a publish routed to a reconnecting client between its registration and the reload of its persisted inflight messages went straight to delivery, while the older inflight message was put back on the queue behind it ([MQTT-4.4.0-1], #151). A connection is now treated as behind until its session has bound, so such a publish is queued after the reloaded message.

### Added

- `MessageRouter::register_unbound_session`, and `ClientQueue::awaiting_bind`, `ClientQueue::expect_bind` and `ClientQueue::mark_bound`.

## [mqtt5 0.44.0] - 2026-09-29

### Breaking

- **`broker::router::Registration` has a new public field, `epoch`**: the session queue's epoch at the moment the connection registered. Code that builds `Registration` with a struct literal must set it.

### Fixed

- **A client that reconnects with a clean start and subscribes before the previous connection has finished handing off now receives its retained messages.** The new connection's packets are handled during the hand-off, so its QoS 1 and 2 retained messages, and publishes routed to its new subscriptions, were queued and then discarded when the session bound. The hand-off can last up to 30 seconds when the previous connection's socket is blocked. A clean start now discards the previous session's queue when the connection registers instead of when it binds.
- **A connection displaced by a clean-start takeover can no longer re-queue its undelivered messages into the new session.** Its re-queues and retained-message pushes are now dropped once the new session has discarded the queue. This also covers a hand-off that timed out while the previous connection was still running.

### Added

- `ClientQueue::requeue_front_in_epoch`.

## [mqttv5-cli 0.29.2] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- Requires mqtt5 0.44.

## [mqtt5-wasm 2.1.2] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- Requires mqtt5 0.44. A connection displaced by a clean-start takeover no longer re-queues undelivered messages into the new session. No change to the wasm API.

## [mqtt5 0.43.1] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- **A clean-start reconnect no longer receives a message routed to the session it replaced.** A publish routed to a client just before that client reconnected with `clean_start=1` could land in the new session's queue after the queue had been cleared, delivering a message for a subscription the new session never made (#150). Each client queue now counts its full clears, and a message routed before the latest one is dropped. A resumed session still receives it.
- **The file backend no longer writes a queued message to disk after it was delivered or cleared.** A message delivered or cleared at the same moment it was queued could have its delete reach the storage writer before its write, leaving the file on disk; after a restart it was loaded again and redelivered. Writes are now handed to the storage writer before the entry becomes visible to delivery or clearing.

### Added

- `ClientQueue::epoch` and `ClientQueue::push_in_epoch`.

## [mqtt5 0.43.0] - 2026-09-27

### Breaking

- **`broker::config::QuicConfig` and `broker::quic_acceptor::QuicAcceptorConfig` have three new public fields**: `max_concurrent_streams`, `stream_receive_window` and `disable_segmentation_offload`. Code that builds either struct with a struct literal must set them; `QuicConfig::new` and `QuicAcceptorConfig::new` set them to their defaults.

### Added

- **Broker QUIC flow-control settings.** `max_concurrent_streams` caps the unidirectional and bidirectional streams a client may open at once (QUIC default 100); `stream_receive_window` sets the per-stream receive window (default 262144 bytes); `disable_segmentation_offload` turns off UDP segmentation offload, so each datagram is sent separately. Set them with `with_max_concurrent_streams`, `with_stream_receive_window` and `with_disable_segmentation_offload`.
- **Per-connection QUIC statistics.** When `MQTT5_QUIC_STATS_DIR` names a directory, the broker writes one CSV per QUIC connection, with a row every 100 ms and a last row at close: RTT, congestion window, lost packets, congestion events and sent packets on the broker's path, and the STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED, DATA_BLOCKED and STREAMS_BLOCKED (uni) frames received from the client. Unset, nothing is sampled.

### Fixed

- **The client's QUIC stream limit is now applied.** `QuicConfig::with_max_concurrent_streams` (and `MqttClient::set_quic_max_streams`, and the bridge's `quic_max_streams`) was stored but never passed to the QUIC transport, so the broker could open up to the QUIC default of 100 streams toward the client. It now caps the streams the broker may open.
- **Eight QUIC multistream integration tests no longer pass without checking anything when a client fails to connect.** They returned early, so with missing test certificates they reported success.

## [mqttv5-cli 0.29.1] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- `mqttv5 broker` flags `--quic-max-streams <N>`, `--quic-stream-window <BYTES>` and `--quic-disable-offload` (environment variables `MQTT5_QUIC_MAX_STREAMS`, `MQTT5_QUIC_STREAM_WINDOW`, `MQTT5_QUIC_DISABLE_OFFLOAD`), backed by the mqtt5 0.43.0 broker settings.
- Requires mqtt5 0.43.

## [mqtt5-wasm 2.1.1] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- Requires mqtt5 0.43. No change to the wasm API.

## [mqtt5 0.42.0] - 2026-09-25

### Breaking

- **An absent Session Expiry Interval in an MQTT v5 CONNECT now means 0**, as §3.1.2.11.2 requires: the session ends when the network connection closes. Before, the broker kept such sessions, with their subscriptions and queued messages, forever. Clients that resume with Clean Start 0 must set a non-zero Session Expiry Interval (`ConnectOptions::with_session_expiry_interval`). For MQTT v3.1.1, CleanSession=0 keeps the session and CleanSession=1 now ends it at disconnect. Reported in #171.
- **`BrokerConfig::session_expiry_interval` is now the maximum Session Expiry the broker grants.** A client that asks for more, or an MQTT v3.1.1 CleanSession=0 session, gets the maximum. MQTT v5 clients are told the granted value in the CONNACK Session Expiry Interval (§3.2.2.3.2); an MQTT v3.1.1 CONNACK carries no properties. A Session Expiry sent on DISCONNECT is capped the same way. The setting was previously unused. Its default is `u32::MAX` seconds (no limit), so nothing is capped unless you set it.
- **With persistence disabled, every connection now has an in-memory session that ends at disconnect.** Will Messages are now published; before, no Will was ever sent without persistence. Because the session ends at disconnect:
  - a delayed Will is published at disconnect;
  - CONNACK returns Session Expiry Interval 0 when the client asked for more;
  - Session Present is always 0;
  - a connection that takes over a ClientID never inherits the previous connection's subscriptions.
- **Session ownership is now one protocol**, verified with TLA+ in `specs/tla/session-ownership/`.
  - **The session slot.** Each ClientID has one. Claiming a session (before CONNACK), applying a SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE or QUIC flow close, releasing a session, and sweeping it each run as one critical section over the router and storage.
  - **What the claim does.** It decides Session Present, writes the session, and sets the router's subscriptions for the ClientID to exactly the session's. A displaced connection changes nothing.
  - **What this fixes:**
    - a SUBSCRIBE racing a takeover left a session that never expired;
    - a failed or aborted handshake overwrote or orphaned a live connection's session;
    - a resumed session kept routing a subscription that is no longer authorized (#173);
    - a takeover or clean start inherited subscriptions;
    - a new connection could claim a session while it was still being released;
    - the sweep could delete a session a new connection had just claimed.
- **The file storage backend group-commits session writes.** Sessions live in one append-only log, `sessions/sessions.log`.
  - A write is visible to later readers at once.
  - One flush appends and fsyncs every pending write.
  - CONNACK, SUBACK/UNSUBACK and the end of DISCONNECT processing wait for the flush that covers their write and every earlier one, so a crash can no longer lose an acknowledged session or bring back a discarded one.
  - A failed flush rejects all pending writes and restores the last durable state.
  - The log is compacted when it is larger than both 1 MB and twice its live size.
  - A SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE is stored in one write however many filters it carries, so it waits for one flush.
  - 1000 concurrent CONNECTs are acknowledged in about 70 ms, where a per-write fsync under a global lock needed about 9 s.
  - The ordering rule (no acknowledgement before the flush covering the write and every earlier one) is model-checked in `specs/tla/session-ownership/`. The failure path (rejecting pending writes, restoring the durable state, repairing the log) is not in the model; it is covered by tests.
- **The session log is robust against damage and failed writes.**
  - Every record carries a CRC-32 and an explicit type (put or remove), so a damaged record is detected instead of being misread, and a damaged update can no longer be replayed as a removal.
  - A damaged record is skipped and replay continues with the records after it. Before, replay stopped at the first damaged record and startup compaction deleted every later session. When anything other than an incomplete last line is discarded, the original log is kept as `sessions/sessions.log.corrupt-<unix millis>` and the broker logs an error.
  - A write whose flush failed is truncated out of the log before the failure is reported, so a restart cannot bring back a write the client was told had failed. If the truncation fails, the log is rewritten; until that succeeds, every session write fails.
  - If the log cannot be rewritten at startup (full disk, read-only directory), the broker starts with the replayed sessions and refuses session writes until a rewrite succeeds, instead of refusing to start.
  - Leftover temporary files from an interrupted write are removed at startup. A legacy session file that cannot be read or parsed during migration is kept as `<name>.corrupt-<unix millis>`, and an unreadable log is moved to `sessions.log.unreadable-<unix millis>`; neither overwrites an earlier copy.
  - The `.storage_version` file is replaced atomically (temp file, fsync, rename, directory fsync).
- **Storage format version 2.** Version 1 directories are migrated on open; older brokers refuse a version 2 directory. **Back up the storage directory before upgrading.** Rolling back means restoring that backup, because older builds refuse version 2. A broker that finds a storage version newer than it supports refuses to start and says to run the version that wrote the directory or restore the backup; it no longer suggests a `mqttv5 storage backup` command, which does not exist. On Windows, the compaction rename relies on NTFS metadata journaling. `FileBackend::flush_sessions`, `FileBackend::start_flush_task`, `DynamicStorage::flush_sessions` and the 5 s flush task are removed. `MessageRouter::recover_sessions` takes the maximum Session Expiry.
- **Sessions survive a broker restart as the protocol requires.** Reported in #172.
  - The disconnect time is persisted (`ClientSession::disconnected_at`), so an ended session expires at its disconnect time plus its expiry.
  - A session that was connected when the broker stopped is treated as disconnected at boot.
  - Expiry-0 sessions are dropped at startup.
  - The router's subscriptions are rebuilt from the persisted sessions, so an offline persistent session receives and queues messages before its client reconnects.
  - Session files from earlier versions still load.
- **`ClientSession` has new public fields.** Code that builds it with a struct literal must add them:
  - `connection_token`, which now holds the router generation of the owning connection;
  - `connected`;
  - `disconnected_at`.
  Router generations are now epoch-qualified, so they don't repeat across restarts.
- **Expired sessions are removed only by the sweep.** `StorageBackend::get_session` and `StorageBackend::cleanup_expired` no longer remove them; `MessageRouter::sweep_sessions` does, and it replaces `MessageRouter::cleanup_stale_subscriptions`.
- `MessageRouter::release_client` reports a missing registration as `Release::Displaced`. `MessageRouter::arm_will` and `MessageRouter::clear_stored_will` identify the connection by its generation.

### Fixed

- **A delayed Will Message is cancelled when a new connection for the same ClientID opens before the Will Delay Interval elapses** (`[MQTT-3.1.3-9]`, `[MQTT-3.1.2-8]`). This holds whether the new connection resumes the session, starts clean, or takes over a live connection. Before, the broker always published the Will after the delay. The pending Will is cancelled when the new session is claimed, before CONNACK. Reported in #154.
- **The Will is published when the Will Delay Interval elapses or the session ends, whichever comes first.** A Session Expiry Interval of 0 publishes it at disconnect.
- **Session Expiry is counted from disconnect**, as §3.1.2.11.2 requires. A connected client's session never expires.
- **A resumed session takes its Session Expiry Interval from the resuming CONNECT** instead of keeping the value from the connection that created it. A live expiry-0 session that is taken over is never resumed.
- **A Session Expiry Interval sent on DISCONNECT is applied** (§3.14.2.2.2). A non-zero value after a CONNECT value of 0 is a Protocol Error: the broker sends DISCONNECT 0x82, closes the connection, publishes the Will, and ends the session. Reported in #171.
- **The CONNACK sent after enhanced authentication carries the same properties as a plain CONNACK**, including a capped Session Expiry Interval. Enhanced authentication now completes before the connection starts its normal packet loop.
- **A published Will, or one deleted by DISCONNECT 0x00, is removed from the stored session state** (`[MQTT-3.1.2-10]`).
- **The connect timeout no longer cancels a claim in progress.** Before, it could leave a router owner with no connection and a session stuck connected.
- **A claim whose write fails gets CONNACK 0x88** and no longer disconnects the live owner. A SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE whose write fails is not acknowledged, and its route change is undone; the broker sends DISCONNECT 0x80 and closes the connection, and the Will is published. A session left connected by a failed release write is ended by the sweep.
- **The DISCONNECT Session Expiry is stored when the DISCONNECT is processed.**
- **Multi-step enhanced authentication applies the Will QoS/Retain checks and the client Receive Maximum**, like a plain CONNECT.
- **A failed multi-step enhanced authentication is refused with CONNACK** carrying the provider's reason code (0x87 Not authorized), or with DISCONNECT during re-authentication. Before, the broker sent an AUTH packet with that reason code, which AUTH may not carry (`[MQTT-3.15.2-1]`).
- **The server's final Authentication Data reaches the client.** It is sent in the CONNACK after enhanced authentication, and in the AUTH 0x00 that ends a re-authentication. Before, it was dropped, so a SCRAM client never received the server signature.
- **Startup recovery is concurrent and caps stored expiry to the configured maximum.** Before, 500 sessions left connected by a crash delayed the first CONNACK by over 5 s. Measured on a Mac release build, the first CONNACK now comes about 44 ms after start with 500 such sessions, and about 0.5 s with 5000. An unreadable session log or legacy session file no longer blocks startup or a ClientID.
- **The connected-clients statistic no longer underflows when a handshake fails.** In debug builds, the underflow made a later handler panic. Reported in #175.
- The conformance test for `[MQTT-3.1.3-9]` passed vacuously. It now waits past the delay, with a positive control. New conformance tests cover an absent Session Expiry and a Session Expiry sent on DISCONNECT.

### Added

- `broker::session_slot` (`SessionSlots`, `SessionSlotGuard`), `MessageRouter::lock_session`, `MessageRouter::set_client_subscriptions`, `MessageRouter::sweep_sessions`, `MessageRouter::recover_sessions`, `MessageRouter::is_current_owner`, `MessageRouter::stored_subscription_request`, `MessageRouter::claim_will`, `MessageRouter::cancel_pending_will`, `MessageRouter::allocate_generation`, `MessageRouter::register_session_as` and `MqttBroker::storage`.
- `StorageBackend::update_session`, `StorageBackend::remove_owned_session`, `StorageBackend::remove_expired_session` and `StorageBackend::session_client_ids`, with default implementations. The first three are atomic in the memory and file backends.
- `ClientSession::expiry_from_connect`, `ClientSession::granted_expiry`, `ClientSession::will_publish_delay`, `ClientSession::mark_connected`, `ClientSession::mark_disconnected` and `broker::storage::unix_millis_now`.

## [mqttv5-cli 0.29.0] - 2026-09-25

### Breaking

- **The broker's file storage is migrated to version 2 on first start**, and the migration is one-way: sessions move into `sessions/sessions.log`, and earlier mqttv5 versions refuse a migrated directory. **Back up the storage directory (`--storage-dir`, default `./mqtt_storage`) before upgrading.** Rolling back means stopping the broker and restoring that backup. Version 1 directories are migrated automatically.
- **`broker --session-expiry` is now an optional maximum Session Expiry the broker grants** (default: no limit). Before, it defaulted to 3600 and had no effect. `broker generate-config` no longer writes a `session_expiry_interval`; add one to set a maximum.
- **The broker ends a session at disconnect when an MQTT v5 client sends no Session Expiry Interval**, as mqtt5 0.42.0 does. Clients that resume with Clean Start 0 must send a non-zero Session Expiry Interval.

### Changed

- `--no-clean-start` without `--session-expiry` now sends a Session Expiry Interval of 1 hour, so the resumed session also survives this run. An explicit `--session-expiry`, including 0, still takes precedence.
- Requires mqtt5 0.42.

## [mqtt5-wasm 2.1.0] - 2026-09-25

### Changed

- **An absent Session Expiry Interval in an MQTT v5 CONNECT now means 0 in the in-browser broker**: the session ends when the connection closes. Clients that resume with Clean Start 0 must set `sessionExpiryInterval`.
- **`BrokerConfig.sessionExpiryIntervalSecs` is now the maximum Session Expiry the broker grants.** It applies to CONNECT and DISCONNECT values and to MQTT v3.1.1 persistent sessions. It is returned in CONNACK only when it caps an MQTT v5 client's value. Its default is 4294967295 (no limit). Before, the broker put 3600 in every CONNACK without applying it.
- **The in-browser broker uses the same session ownership protocol as mqtt5 0.42.0.** A clean start, or a takeover of a live expiry-0 session, never resumes or inherits the previous session's subscriptions (#174). SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE from a displaced connection change nothing. Expired sessions are swept periodically.
- Requires mqtt5 0.42.

### Added

- `BrokerConfig.sessionSweepIntervalSecs` (default 3600 s).

### Fixed

- **The in-browser broker cancels a delayed Will when the client reconnects within the Will Delay Interval**, and publishes it no later than session end. This is the same fix as mqtt5 0.42.0.
- **Session Expiry is counted from disconnect.** A resumed session takes the resuming CONNECT's Session Expiry, and a Session Expiry sent on DISCONNECT is applied, as in mqtt5 0.42.0. A non-zero value after 0 is answered with DISCONNECT 0x82.
- **Will Delay Intervals longer than about 24.8 days no longer fire immediately or throw.** The timer now sleeps in chunks.
- **The in-browser broker detects a client closing its MessagePort** (the port's `close` event) and treats it as an abnormal disconnect, so the Will is published. Before, a closed port went unnoticed until keep-alive expiry, and never with a keep-alive of 0, which also leaked the connection handler. Environments that don't raise `close` on MessagePort still rely on keep-alive expiry.
- **Enhanced authentication completes before the connection starts serving**, and its CONNACK carries the capped Session Expiry.
- **The claimed session is stored before the connection is registered**, so a failed write can't disconnect the live owner; the client gets CONNACK Server Unavailable. Failing to discard queued or inflight messages on Clean Start is only logged.
- **A published Will, or one deleted by DISCONNECT 0x00, is removed from the stored session** (`[MQTT-3.1.2-10]`).

## [mqtt5 0.41.0] - 2026-09-23

A client-side conformance audit drove the real `MqttClient` against a raw-byte fake broker for each of the 149 normative statements in MQTT v5.0 that apply to a client. About 40 MUST statements failed. All are fixed here, and each is pinned by a test named after its OASIS statement ID in `crates/mqtt5/tests/conf_client_{a,b,c,d}.rs`.

### Breaking

- **A fresh client that receives Session Present=1 now closes the connection** with DISCONNECT 0x82 and `connect` returns an error, as `[MQTT-3.2.2-4]` requires. A client instance counts as holding session state once it has connected before. To resume a broker-held session from a freshly started process on purpose (the deferred-ack crash-recovery pattern), set the new `ConnectOptions::resume_existing_session` / `with_resume_existing_session(true)`. Session Present=1 in answer to Clean Start=1 is always rejected.
- **`ConnectOptions` has a new public field, `resume_existing_session`.** Code that builds `ConnectOptions` with a struct literal must add it.
- **Invalid outbound requests are now rejected before anything is sent.** This covers topic names with wildcards, empty topics without a Topic Alias, malformed topic filters and `$share` filters, wildcard Response Topics, Subscription Identifiers on PUBLISH or 0 on SUBSCRIBE, and Topic Alias 0 or above the server maximum. It also covers RETAIN when the server reports Retain Available=0, wildcard, shared or subscription-identifier subscriptions the server reports unavailable, and SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE over the server Maximum Packet Size. Previously all of these were sent and left for the broker to reject.
- **Removed the deprecated session-level retained message store.** It was scheduled for removal in 0.32.0 and nothing in the client or broker used it. The broker's retained messages (`broker::storage::RetainedMessage`, `MessageRouter::get_retained_messages`) are unaffected. Removed:
  - the `mqtt5::session::retained` module
  - `RetainedMessageStore` and `RetainedMessage`, and their `mqtt5::session` re-exports
  - `SessionState::store_retained_message`, `get_retained_messages` and `retained_messages`
  - `test_utils::test_retained_message`
  - `test_utils::TestMessageBuilder::build_retained_batch`
- **Removed the deprecated `WebSocketConfig::with_tls_verification` and `WebSocketConfig::verify_tls`.** Nothing read `verify_tls`. Use `tls_config`.
- **`PublishResult` now reports the real outcome of a publish.**
  - It is `Sent(Delivery)` for an acknowledged publish, or `Queued(PublishHandle)` for a QoS 1/2 publish whose outcome is still open. That covers one queued while offline, and a live publish whose connection ended, whose client disconnected, or whose 10 s acknowledgement wait elapsed before the ack arrived. Such a publish used to return `Err` even though the message stayed in the session and was resent. `publish()` now returns an error only when the message definitely was not delivered. `QoS0` and `QoS1Or2 { packet_id }` are removed.
  - `Delivery` says which QoS was actually used: `Unconfirmed`, `AtLeastOnce { packet_id }` or `ExactlyOnce { packet_id }`.
  - A `PublishHandle` can be awaited. It settles exactly once to a `PublishOutcome`:
    - `Delivered(Delivery)`
    - `Rejected(PublishRejection)`: definitely not delivered
    - `Indeterminate(IndeterminateReason)`: may have been delivered
  - `PublishResult::outcome()` gives the outcome on either path.
  - `mqtt5` no longer re-exports `mqtt5_protocol::PublishResult`.
  - The design is verified in TLA+ in `specs/tla/offline-queue/`.
- **`MessageRouter::subscribe` and `subscribe_as` now take a `SubscriptionRequest`** instead of 10 or 11 separate arguments. Build one with `SubscriptionRequest::new(client_id, topic_filter, qos)` and the `with_*` setters. The defaults match the values callers passed before.
- **The broker rejects packets with non-zero reserved fixed-header flags on every packet type** (`[MQTT-2.1.3-1]`). This covers CONNECT, PINGREQ, DISCONNECT and AUTH, which were previously accepted; SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, PUBREL and the acks were already checked. The check comes from `mqtt5-protocol` 0.15.2, so an `mqtt5` 0.40 broker picks it up through `cargo update`.
- **With deferred ack enabled, an unresolved `AckToken` holds back every later PUBACK/PUBREC on that connection**, including automatic acks for plain subscriptions, because acks must go out in arrival order (`[MQTT-4.6.0-2]`, `[MQTT-4.6.0-3]`). An application that holds a token until some later message arrives can stall itself once the broker's in-flight window fills.

### Fixed

- **Unacknowledged QoS 1/2 PUBLISH and PUBREL are resent when a session resumes** (`[MQTT-4.4.0-1]`), with DUP=1, their original packet identifiers and in their original order (`[MQTT-4.6.0-1]`, `[MQTT-4.6.0-4]`), and within the new connection's Receive Maximum. Before, they were stored and never resent, so QoS 1/2 delivery did not survive a reconnect. QoS 1 entries are now also removed on PUBACK. They used to accumulate forever.
- **Packet identifiers are no longer reused while in flight** (`[MQTT-2.2.1-3]`, `[MQTT-4.3.2-1]`). Allocation skips identifiers held by unacknowledged PUBLISH, outstanding PUBREL and pending SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE.
- **The offline queue goes through the normal publish path.** It used to bypass the send quota, unacknowledged-message tracking, Maximum QoS and Retain Available, and it set DUP=1 on a message's first transmission (`[MQTT-4.3.2-2]`, `[MQTT-3.3.4-7]`, `[MQTT-3.2.2-11]`, `[MQTT-3.2.2-14]`).
- **Send quota is reset on every connection** (`[MQTT-4.9.0-1]`). A publish that timed out waiting for its ack no longer leaks its Receive Maximum slot across reconnects. `disconnect()` is no longer delayed while publishes wait for quota (`[MQTT-3.3.4-8]`).
- **Topic Alias Maximum is enforced and reset on each CONNACK** (`[MQTT-3.2.2-17]`, `[MQTT-3.2.2-18]`). Inbound Topic Aliases are resolved per connection (`[MQTT-3.3.2-10]`). An inbound alias of 0 or above the client maximum is a protocol error. Before, an aliased PUBLISH with an empty topic was acknowledged and then dropped.
- **Protocol errors close the connection properly.** On a malformed packet or protocol violation the client sends DISCONNECT with the matching reason code (0x81, 0x82, 0x93, 0x94, 0x95), flushes it, and closes the network connection. Previously it only marked itself disconnected, kept the socket open, and kept sending PINGREQ. A server DISCONNECT now closes the connection too (`[MQTT-4.13.2-1]`). Nothing is written after the client's own DISCONNECT (`[MQTT-3.14.4-1]`).
- **Inbound checks added:**
  - reserved flags on SUBACK, PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE (`[MQTT-2.1.3-1]`)
  - the client's advertised Receive Maximum (0x93) and Maximum Packet Size (0x95)
  - Subscription Identifier 0
  - Request Problem Information=0: a Reason String or User Property on a packet other than PUBLISH, CONNACK or DISCONNECT is a protocol error
- **Acknowledgements go out in PUBLISH arrival order when deferred ack is enabled** (`[MQTT-4.6.0-2]`, `[MQTT-4.6.0-3]`). Automatic acks and `AckToken` acks now share one ordered release, so a later ack waits for earlier pending ones. `AckToken::reject` maps reason codes that are invalid for PUBACK/PUBREC to 0x80. Acks still queued when the connection drops are discarded if the new connection reports Session Present=0.
- **WebSocket reads reassemble MQTT packets from the byte stream** (`[MQTT-6.0.0-2]`). Several packets in one frame, or one packet split across frames, used to corrupt payloads or drop the session. A text frame closes the connection (`[MQTT-6.0.0-1]`), and a WebSocket Ping no longer ends the session.
- **QUIC connections close on protocol errors too.** After sending DISCONNECT the client closes the QUIC connection with an application close code and stops its stream readers. Before, it kept accepting server streams and acknowledging messages after its own DISCONNECT. The client's Maximum Packet Size is enforced on QUIC control and data streams (0x95). Topic Aliases are resolved on unidirectional streams. A malformed or oversized packet on a data stream now fails the connection instead of silently dropping that stream. The same goes for a QoS 1/2 PUBLISH on a unidirectional stream, which cannot carry its acknowledgement (DISCONNECT 0x82). Before, it was dropped silently.
- **A publish that waits for send quota across a reconnect is checked again against the new connection** before it is sent: Maximum QoS, Retain Available, Maximum Packet Size and Topic Alias range. Its quota claim is bound to the connection it was taken on, so it can no longer go out uncounted and exceed Receive Maximum (`[MQTT-3.3.4-7]`).
- **Acks released before a Session Present=0 reconnect are dropped** instead of being applied to the new session. Before, a later QoS 2 message reusing that packet identifier could be suppressed as a duplicate.
- **Offline-queued messages are no longer lost silently.**
  - An offline RETAIN publish is rejected immediately if the last CONNACK reported Retain Available=0.
  - At flush, a queued message that no longer fits the new connection (RETAIN not available, larger than Maximum Packet Size) is reported `Rejected` and the flush continues. It used to be dropped with only a log line after `publish()` had returned success.
  - A message above the new Maximum QoS is downgraded, and its outcome reports the QoS actually used.
- **Session resume no longer resends messages the new connection does not allow.** Before resending, each stored PUBLISH is checked against the new Retain Available, Maximum Packet Size and Maximum QoS. One that fails is not sent and is reported `Indeterminate`. A QoS 2 packet identifier abandoned this way is kept out of reuse until the session is lost, so the broker cannot treat a new message as a duplicate. PUBRELs are always resent.
- **Unacknowledged messages are handled explicitly when the session is lost or discarded.** When a Clean Start=0 reconnect gets Session Present=0, unacknowledged QoS 1 messages are sent again first, in order. A QoS 2 message still waiting for PUBREC is reported `Indeterminate`. One that already received PUBREC Success is reported `Delivered`, because the receiver owns it from that point. A Clean Start=1 connect discards unacknowledged session state and reports it (`[MQTT-3.1.2-4]`). Queued messages that were never sent are kept.
- **Races in the offline flush are closed:**
  - A flush or replay task from a replaced connection can no longer write to that connection or store after reconnect.
  - The packet identifiers of queued, in-flush and staged messages cannot be reallocated.
  - Send quota is released when storing a flushed message fails.
- **Connection loss closes the send quota.** Publishes waiting for quota fail immediately with `NotConnected`, instead of waiting out the 30 s backpressure timeout. An interrupted offline flush no longer keeps handles pending after the client is dropped; they resolve `Indeterminate(Abandoned)`.
- **Acknowledgements settle the publish outcome before session state is released**, so a disconnect while an ack is being processed cannot leave a delivered publish unsettled or misreported.
- **A QoS 2 packet identifier abandoned during replay is quarantined before it leaves the session store**, and a queued message downgraded to QoS 0 stays queued if the connection ends before it is written.
- **A replay stuck on a dead, replaced connection can no longer block the next connection's replay and flush or starve its send quota.** A replay task stops writing as soon as its connection ends.
- **Connection loss detected by keepalive fully ends the connection.** It closes the send quota, releases in-flight publish waiters, and stops the packet reader.
- **A PUBACK, PUBREC or PUBCOMP that does not match the QoS stage of its packet identifier is a protocol error** (DISCONNECT 0x82). Before, it released the outbound state. New: `session::state::OutboundStage` and `SessionState::outbound_stage`.
- **PUBACK, PUBREC and PUBCOMP received on a QUIC server-opened data stream settle the publish outcome and are stage-checked** exactly as on the control stream.
- **A PUBREC with an error reason code reports the publish as rejected only after its stored state has been removed.** If processing is interrupted before that, the publish stays pending and is resent on session resume. An error-code PUBREC for a packet identifier already at the PUBREL stage is a protocol error (DISCONNECT 0x82).
- **The broker bridge counts a publish as sent only once it is acknowledged.**
- **Packet identifier allocation no longer scans the offline queue.** With tens of thousands of queued messages, each `publish` used to spend over a second of CPU without yielding.
- **On MQTT 3.1.1 connections, v5-only publish properties are ignored instead of rejected.** They were never encoded anyway. This covers Topic Alias, Response Topic and Subscription Identifier. Topic names are still validated.
- **CONNECT carries `request_problem_information`, `request_response_information` and user properties**, which were silently dropped. The client never sends AUTH when CONNECT had no Authentication Method (`[MQTT-4.12.0-7]`). The Assigned Client Identifier is adopted for later reconnects (`[MQTT-3.1.3-2]`).

## [mqttv5-cli 0.28.8] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- Depends on `mqtt5` 0.41. `pub` and `sub` with `--no-clean-start` set `resume_existing_session`, so they resume the broker-held session as before.
- `pub` and `bench` report an error when a QoS 1/2 publish is not acknowledged, instead of printing success.

## [mqtt5-wasm 2.0.0] - 2026-09-23

### Breaking

- **The Rust option methods are now snake_case.** On `WasmConnectOptions`, `WasmReconnectOptions`, `WasmPublishOptions`, `WasmSubscribeOptions`, `WasmWillMessage` and `MessageProperties`, `set_keepAlive` is now `set_keep_alive`, `cleanStart` is now `clean_start`, and so on. Rust code that calls these methods must be updated. **The JavaScript/TypeScript API is unchanged**: every property and method keeps its camelCase JS name. Only the raw wasm export symbols in the generated `InitOutput` interface are renamed (for example `connectoptions_cleanStart` is now `connectoptions_clean_start`). That affects only code that calls the raw exports directly.
- **A freshly created client now rejects Session Present=1** with DISCONNECT 0x82, and `connect` fails, as `[MQTT-3.2.2-4]` requires. Set `resumeExistingSession` to resume a broker-held session from a new client instance on purpose. A client instance that has connected before, including one that auto-reconnects, resumes normally.
- **Invalid requests are rejected before anything is sent**, and QoS 1/2 publishes wait while the server's Receive Maximum is exhausted.
- **A publish above the server's Maximum QoS is downgraded and the QoS used is reported.** `publishWithOptions` now resolves with the QoS used (`Promise<number>`, previously `Promise<void>`), and `publishQos1`/`publishQos2` callbacks receive it as a second argument. At Maximum QoS 0 they resolve with packet id 0 and call the callback with `(0, 0)`.
- **Pending publishes settle with an `indeterminate: ...` error, not reason code 128, when their outcome is unknown.** This happens when the session is discarded by Clean Start, lost (Session Present=0), ends with the connection, or holds a message that no longer fits the new connection's limits. The message says the publish may have been delivered.

### Added

- **`ConnectOptions.resumeExistingSession`.** It lets a freshly created client accept Session Present=1 from a broker-held session. The `session-recovery` and `qos2-recovery` examples use it.

### Fixed

- **The browser client now follows the same client-side conformance rules as the native client.** This release fixes the missing PUBACK for inbound QoS 1 messages, byte loss when several packets arrived in one frame, packet identifier reuse, and the missing resend on session resume. It also adds topic and filter validation, and enforcement of the server's Receive Maximum, Topic Alias Maximum, Maximum QoS, Retain Available and Maximum Packet Size. Protocol errors now send DISCONNECT with a reason code and close the transport. With `keepAlive=0`, the client no longer sends PINGREQs. Tests: `crates/mqtt5-wasm/tests/conformance_client.rs`, now run in CI under Node.
- **Session lifetime follows the protocol.** With MQTT 3.1.1 and `cleanStart=false`, the session now survives connection loss. Before, it was discarded, and the reconnect was then rejected forever. With MQTT v5, the Session Expiry Interval from the server's CONNACK takes precedence over the requested one. Automatic reconnects send Clean Start=0 only while the client still holds session state (or `resumeExistingSession` is set), and Clean Start=1 otherwise. The native client instead always reconnects with the configured Clean Start.
- **`disconnect()` settles pending publish promises and QoS callbacks** with a "message remains in session" error when the session outlives the connection. Before, they could hang forever. A later `connect` on the same instance resumes the session and resends.
- **Resent PUBRELs are counted against a lowered Receive Maximum** after a resume (`[MQTT-3.3.4-7]`).
- **Session resume re-checks each unacknowledged PUBLISH against the new CONNACK** (Retain Available, Maximum Packet Size, Maximum QoS). A message that no longer fits is not resent, and its promise or callback settles as indeterminate. A QoS 2 packet identifier abandoned this way is not reused until the session is discarded, so the broker cannot mistake a new message for a duplicate. PUBRELs are still resent.
- **When a Clean Start=0 reconnect gets Session Present=0**, unacknowledged QoS 1 publishes are sent again as new messages (DUP=0, original order) and resolve on acknowledgement. Unacknowledged QoS 2 publishes settle as indeterminate. A connect with Clean Start=1 discards the client's session state before CONNECT (`[MQTT-3.1.2-4]`).
- **A publish waiting for send quota fails instead of going out on a different connection** if the connection changed while it waited.
- **Publishes on MQTT 3.1.1 connections are encoded as 3.1.1.** They used to be encoded as v5, which corrupted the payload. v5-only properties are ignored on 3.1.1.
- **The in-browser broker no longer panics on the first routed PUBLISH.** Before, `tokio::time::Instant` was called on wasm32.

### Changed

- Depends on `mqtt5` 0.41 and `mqtt5-protocol` 0.15.2.

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.15.2] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- **`PacketIdGenerator::next_available(in_use)`** returns the next identifier that isn't in use, or `None` when all are taken.
- **`validation::is_valid_subscription_filter` / `validate_subscription_filter`** validate topic filters, including the `$share/{ShareName}/{filter}` rules (`[MQTT-4.8.2-1]`, `[MQTT-4.8.2-2]`).

### Fixed

- Packet decoding now checks fixed-header reserved flags for every packet type (`[MQTT-2.1.3-1]`).
- `TopicAliasManager` no longer overflows when the alias maximum is 65535.

## [mqtt5 0.40.0] - 2026-09-08

### Breaking

- **`MessageRouter::register_client` now takes a `DeliveryLanes` (two per-client lane senders) and a `QueueHandle` instead of a single delivery-channel sender, and new public types back the per-client delivery queue** (`ClientQueue`, `QueueHandle`, `QueueLimits`, `QueueRegistry`, `DeliveryLanes`, `Registration`, `Release`, and related). Code that drives the router directly — a custom broker front-end, as `mqtt5-wasm` does — must build the two lanes and obtain the client's queue handle; in-process broker use through `MqttBroker` is unaffected.

### Fixed

- **A saturating QoS 1 flood to a slow but still-connected subscriber no longer stalls delivery or grows broker memory without bound.** When a subscriber's bounded delivery channel filled, QoS >= 1 messages were diverted into the offline queue — the structure meant for *disconnected* clients — which was unbounded and never drained while the client stayed connected, so delivery to that subscriber stalled and broker RSS grew from ~9 MB to ~15 GB in a single run. The offline and live paths are now one ordered, bounded, back-pressured path: a per-client `ClientQueue` (bounded, drop-oldest) drained in bounded batches; two delivery lanes with a real Receive-Maximum window; the PUBACK/PUBREC withheld until the message is placed; and session takeover, clean-start discard, and bridge ingress reworked to keep it correct under the new model. The in-browser `mqtt5-wasm` broker moves to the same path. Reported in issue #148; two narrow residual edge cases are tracked as #150 and #151.

## [mqttv5-cli 0.28.7] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- Depends on `mqtt5` 0.40.

## [mqtt5-wasm 1.4.6] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- Depends on `mqtt5` 0.40 and `mqtt5-protocol` 0.15.1. The wasm broker's delivery path moves to the same bounded per-client delivery queue as the native broker (see mqtt5 0.40.0).

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.15.1] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **`Properties::subscription_identifiers()` and `Properties::remove_subscription_identifiers()`** — read every Subscription Identifier on a packet, or strip them all. Used by the broker's bridge ingress to deliver each overlapping topic mapping exactly once.

## [mqtt5 0.39.3] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- **Concurrent publishes to the same topic no longer race to open duplicate per-topic QUIC streams.** Under the per-topic delivery strategy the broker caches one server-initiated QUIC stream per topic in `topic_streams`. To send, `send_on_topic_stream` **removed** the stream's `StreamInfo` (owning the `SendStream`) from the map, wrote to it, then re-inserted it. Two publishes to the same topic that overlapped in that window found the entry absent and each opened a fresh stream, so a hot topic accumulated redundant streams, evicted other topics' cached streams under `max_cached_streams`, and reported an inflated per-topic stream count. The cache now holds each stream as an `Arc<StreamInfo>` whose `SendStream` sits behind its own `Mutex` (and `last_used` behind a `std::sync::Mutex`); `get_or_create_topic_stream` keeps the entry in the map and returns a shared handle, and a send locks only that stream's mutex. Concurrent sends to one topic now share the single cached stream, serialized by its mutex, instead of racing to create duplicates. Landed in #152, which lacked a changelog note for this broker change.

## [mqtt5 0.39.2] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **The broker now sends `DISCONNECT` with reason code 0x8E (Session taken over) to the displaced client on session takeover**, as `[MQTT-3.1.4-3]` requires, before closing its connection. Previously it only closed the socket, so the superseded client saw a plain network drop and could not tell a takeover from any other loss. A client that reports disconnect reasons (mqtt5 0.39.0 and later) now receives `DisconnectReason::ServerDisconnect(SessionTakenOver)` and can decide not to reconnect into a takeover flap. The conformance test for `[MQTT-3.1.4-3]` previously accepted a bare close; it now requires the `DISCONNECT`. Reported in issue #147.

## [mqtt5 0.39.1] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- **A panicking subscription callback no longer stops message delivery for the whole client.** Every delivered message ran through a single lazily-spawned worker task that invoked the user callback with no panic isolation. A callback panic unwound the worker, the `OnceLock` kept handing out the dead channel's sender, and `dispatch` discarded the send error, so from then on every message routed through that manager was silently dropped while the connection stayed up and `is_connected()` kept returning `true`. It survived reconnects, since the manager is built once per client. The `subscribe_with_ack` worker had the same defect. Both workers now run each callback under `catch_unwind`, log the panic at `error` level with the topic, and keep going, so one panicking callback loses one message instead of the client. If a worker is ever gone, `CallbackManager::dispatch` now logs and returns an error rather than dropping the message silently, and the ack worker logs the drop. Connection event callbacks run under the same isolation. Reported in issue #124.

## [mqtt5 0.39.0] - 2026-09-05

### Breaking

- **`ConnectionEvent`, `DisconnectReason`, and `ReasonCode` are now `#[non_exhaustive]`.** New reason codes and event variants stay additive from here on, so a `match` on any of these enums outside the crate needs a wildcard arm. `DisconnectReason::ServerClosed`, which nothing ever produced, is removed; a broker-initiated disconnect is now reported as `DisconnectReason::ServerDisconnect(ReasonCode)` carrying the broker's reason code.
- **`MqttClient::on_error` and `MqttClient::clear_error_callbacks` are removed, along with the `ErrorCallback` type.** The registered callbacks were never invoked: the only place they could have been hooked is the reader error path, which now feeds `ConnectionEvent::Disconnected` with a reason, so wiring them would have reported the same failure twice. Use `on_connection_event` instead. Reported in issue #125.

### Fixed

- **The client now reports that a connection was lost, and why.** `ConnectionEvent::Disconnected` previously fired only for an application-initiated `disconnect()` and one custom-TLS connect-failure path; a dropped TCP connection, a broker `DISCONNECT`, or a keepalive timeout only flipped an internal flag, so a subscriber saw `Connected`, later another `Connected`, and never learned anything was lost in between. The packet reader now emits `Disconnected` when it terminates, with the reason derived from the cause: `ServerDisconnect(reason_code)` for a broker `DISCONNECT`, whose reason code was previously logged and discarded; `NetworkError` for a transport drop; `AuthFailure` for a failed re-authentication; `ProtocolError` otherwise. The keepalive task emits `Disconnected { KeepAliveTimeout }` on a missed `PINGRESP` and `NetworkError` when a `PINGREQ` cannot be written. Each connection emits at most one `Disconnected`: the transition is a compare-and-swap on the connection flag guarded by the connection epoch, so a client-initiated `disconnect()` reports only `ClientInitiated` and a stale task from a previous connection reports nothing. Reported in issue #123.
- **`ConnectionEvent::Connecting` and `ConnectionEvent::ReconnectFailed` now fire.** Both were declared, documented, and matched in the examples, but the client never produced them. `Connecting` fires on the initial `connect` / `connect_with_options` (plain and TLS), `Reconnecting { attempt }` on each automatic retry, and `ReconnectFailed { error }` when the reconnection loop gives up for good, either because `max_attempts` was exhausted or because no address was recorded to reconnect to. Previously the monitor task exited silently in both cases and the client stayed offline with no signal. Reported in issue #123.
- **A failed connect no longer emits `Disconnected` on the custom-TLS path.** `connect_with_tls_and_options` emitted `Disconnected { NetworkError }` when the initial connection failed, while the plain TCP path (correctly) emitted nothing, since the client was never connected. The two paths now agree.

## [mqttv5-cli 0.28.6] - 2026-09-05

### Changed

- Depends on `mqtt5` 0.39, so the CLI's connection-event logging now sees `Connecting`, a reasoned `Disconnected`, and `ReconnectFailed`.

## [mqtt5-wasm 1.4.5] - 2026-09-05

### Changed

- Depends on `mqtt5` 0.39 and `mqtt5-protocol` 0.15.

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.15.0] - 2026-09-05

### Breaking

- **`ConnectionEvent`, `DisconnectReason`, and `ReasonCode` are `#[non_exhaustive]`; `DisconnectReason::ServerClosed` is replaced by `ServerDisconnect(ReasonCode)`.** See mqtt5 0.39.0.
- **`MqttError::ServerDisconnect(ReasonCode)` is added.** The client's packet handlers return it for a broker-sent `DISCONNECT` instead of a `ConnectionError` built from a fixed string, so the reason code survives to the application.

## [mqtt5 0.38.5] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- **The broker configuration hot-reload now watches the linked authentication files, not just the main config file.** `HotReloadManager` previously polled only the config file's modification time, so editing an ACL, password, or SCRAM file referenced by the running config (for example via `mqttv5 acl ...`) was not applied until the config file itself changed or the broker received `SIGHUP`. The watcher now also checks `auth_config.acl_file`, `auth_config.password_file`, and `auth_config.scram_file` by content hash and reloads the authentication provider when any of them changes, so ACL and credential edits take effect automatically within the watch interval. Hot-reload still requires the broker to be started with a config file. Reported in discussion #139.

## [mqtt5 0.38.4] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- **`ClientConnectEvent` and `ClientDisconnectEvent` now carry the authenticated `user_id`.** Both broker event structs gain a `user_id: Option<Arc<str>>` field, populated from the client handler's authenticated identity at the connect and disconnect emission sites, mirroring the existing `ClientPublishEvent::user_id`. These are in-process broker→handler callback structs, not wire packets, so this is not an MQTT protocol change and is rolling-upgrade neutral. The field is additive and `None` for unauthenticated connections; default `BrokerEventHandler` implementations are unaffected. This lets a downstream handler emit per-user presence events (client connect/disconnect keyed by authenticated user) without threading identity through a side channel.

## [mqtt5 0.38.3] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **The client now enforces the broker's advertised Receive Maximum on outbound QoS 1 and QoS 2 publishes.** MQTT v5.0 §4.9 requires that a Client MUST NOT send more than the Server's Receive Maximum count of unacknowledged QoS 1 and QoS 2 PUBLISH packets, yet the client publish path never captured the value from the CONNACK and never acquired a send-quota permit before sending: the outbound `FlowControlManager` was constructed once with the default window (65 535) and never reprogrammed, and its `acquire_send_quota`/`acknowledge` API had no callers on the publish path. The only bound on concurrent in-flight publishes was the application's own concurrency. Against a broker advertising a small Receive Maximum (for example mosquitto's default of 20), the client would burst past the window, and a strict peer is entitled to respond with a `ReceiveMaximumExceeded` DISCONNECT. The in-tree broker masked the defect because its own default `server_receive_maximum` is also 65 535 and its inbound check populated no in-flight entry on the immediate-PUBACK QoS 1 path. The client now captures the CONNACK Receive Maximum (absent ⇒ 65 535), rejects a CONNACK advertising a Receive Maximum of 0 as a Protocol Error (`[MQTT-3.2.2-4]`), acquires a send-quota permit before each outbound QoS 1/2 PUBLISH (blocking with backpressure once the window is full), and releases it on PUBACK for QoS 1, on PUBCOMP for QoS 2, and early on an error PUBREC (reason ≥ 0x80). The QoS 2 release point was verified in TLA+ (`specs/tla/outbound-receive-max/`): releasing on a success PUBREC rather than on PUBCOMP lets a fresh PUBLISH exceed the window while the PUBREL/PUBCOMP exchange is still outstanding, which the model refutes as a window-bound violation.

## [mqtt5 0.38.2] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- **The broker no longer forwards a publisher's Topic Alias to subscribers.** When a PUBLISH carried a Topic Alias, the broker resolved it to a topic name but left the Topic Alias property on the packet, so live delivery carried it through to subscribers — including subscribers that advertised no Topic Alias Maximum, whose value is therefore zero. This violates `[MQTT-3.1.2-26]`, `[MQTT-3.1.2-27]` and `[MQTT-3.3.2-11]`: a Topic Alias mapping is scoped to a single Network Connection and to the server-to-client direction, so a publisher's alias has no meaning on a subscriber's connection and must not be sent to a client that did not offer to receive one. A subscriber advertising Topic Alias Maximum 2 could receive a delivered PUBLISH carrying Topic Alias 9. Retained, queued and inflight deliveries were unaffected because they rebuild the packet from an explicit field list; only live delivery leaked. `resolve_topic_alias` now strips the Topic Alias property once the topic name is resolved. Reported in issue #130.
- **The broker now sets `TCP_NODELAY` on every accepted TCP connection.** None of the broker's accept paths — plain TCP, TLS, WebSocket, WebSocket over TLS, and cluster — disabled Nagle's algorithm on the socket returned by `accept()`, so broker-to-subscriber delivery ran with Nagle enabled while the client side already set the option. Interacting with the peer's delayed-ACK timer, this added roughly 5 ms to median delivery latency and pinned the tail at the Linux 40 ms delayed-ACK boundary; QUIC was unaffected because it does not run over TCP. MQTT delivery is a stream of small, latency-sensitive writes, which is exactly the case Nagle harms, so the broker now disables it on each accepted socket before wrapping it in a transport. Reported in issue #128.
- **The broker no longer exceeds the client's Maximum Packet Size when attaching a Reason String.** CONNACK, SUBACK, PUBACK, PUBREC and AUTH could carry a Reason String without consulting the Maximum Packet Size the client advertised in CONNECT, which MQTT v5.0 forbids (`[MQTT-3.2.2-19]`, `[MQTT-3.4.2-2]`, `[MQTT-3.5.2-2]`, `[MQTT-3.15.2-2]`). The overrun could be driven by the peer: the "not authorized" PUBACK/PUBREC interpolated the client's own topic name into the Reason String, so a large topic produced a correspondingly large acknowledgement, and a topic of 65 500 bytes overflowed the u16 Reason-String length and dropped the connection with no DISCONNECT. Outbound control packets now pass through a single write-path choke point that omits the Reason String and re-encodes when the packet would exceed the client's limit, and discards the packet only if it still does not fit (`[MQTT-3.1.2-24]`). The capture of the client's Maximum Packet Size was hoisted to before authentication so the enhanced-authentication failure CONNACK — reachable by any peer on a default broker — also honours it. The AUTH-failure Reason String now additionally respects Request Problem Information (`[MQTT-3.1.2-29]`), and the peer's topic name is no longer interpolated into any Reason String. A CONNECT advertising a Maximum Packet Size of 0 — a Protocol Error under MQTT v5.0 3.1.2.11.4 — is now rejected with a Protocol Error CONNACK instead of being accepted as a zero limit that would discard every outbound packet, including the CONNACK itself. Reported in issue #129.

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.14.3] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- **`Properties::remove_topic_alias`** removes the Topic Alias property from a property set. The broker uses it to strip a publisher's inbound Topic Alias after resolving it to a topic name, so the alias is not carried into the message routed to subscribers (see mqtt5 0.38.2).
- **`Properties::remove_reason_string`** removes the Reason String property from a property set. The broker uses it to omit the Reason String from an outbound control packet that would otherwise exceed the client's Maximum Packet Size (see mqtt5 0.38.2).

## [mqttv5-cli 0.28.5] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **`mqttv5 sub --show-properties` (`-s`)** prints the MQTT v5 properties of each received message alongside its payload, not just the payload. When set, the subscriber renders the delivered `QoS`, the retain flag, and every present property — payload format indicator, message expiry interval, content type, response topic, correlation data (hex), subscription identifiers, and user properties — one per line, followed by the payload. Without the flag the output is unchanged (payload only, or `topic: payload` under `--verbose`).
- **`mqttv5 broker --no-sys-topics` and `--sys-interval <DUR>`** expose the broker's `$SYS` statistics publishing on the command line. `--no-sys-topics` disables `$SYS` publishing (enabled by default); `--sys-interval` sets the publish interval and accepts a bare number of seconds or a duration such as `10s` or `1m` (default `10`). Both map to the existing `BrokerConfig` fields, so an interval of zero while `$SYS` is enabled is still rejected at config validation. Addresses issue #115.

## [mqtt5 0.38.1] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **`ConnectOptions::validate_deferred_ack` now rejects deferred acknowledgement on an MQTT v3.1.1 connection.** Deferred ack depends on two preconditions — a non-zero Session Expiry Interval and a non-zero Receive Maximum — that are carried by CONNECT properties which exist only in MQTT 5.0. On a v3.1.1 connection those properties never reach the wire, so validation passed while the Receive Maximum window stayed unbounded and the broker had no knowledge of the client's intent; a rejected or dropped token then also emitted a v5-shaped PUBACK/PUBREC, malformed on v3.1.1 whose acknowledgements carry no reason code or properties. `validate_deferred_ack` now fails fast with a `Configuration` error when `deferred_ack` is set on any protocol version other than v5, before the session checks. Reported in issue #121.

## [mqtt5 0.38.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **`MqttBroker::quic_local_addr()`**, returning the address the first QUIC endpoint is bound to. This mirrors `local_addr` / `tls_local_addr` / `ws_local_addr` and lets a broker bound to port 0 report the port the OS assigned.
- **Deferred acknowledgement for inbound `QoS` 1 and `QoS` 2 messages, via `MqttClient::subscribe_with_ack` and `AckToken`.** A normal subscription acknowledges each message the moment the client's reader hands it to the application, so the acknowledgement says only "received", not "processed". A deferred subscription instead delivers the message together with a move-only `AckToken` and withholds the acknowledgement — the PUBACK for `QoS` 1, the PUBREC for `QoS` 2 — until the application calls `token.ack()`. `token.reject(reason)` sends an error acknowledgement instead, and dropping the token without resolving it auto-acknowledges with a reason code and logs a warning, so a forgotten token can never wedge the flow. Because the acknowledgement is the broker's cue to advance or release the message, deferring it makes the acknowledgement mean "processed", and the inbound Receive Maximum window becomes real end-to-end backpressure: the broker stops sending once the application's unacknowledged messages fill the window. The feature is opt-in through `ConnectOptions::with_deferred_ack(true)` and is gated at connect time to a persistent session (clean start off, a non-zero Session Expiry Interval) with a non-zero Receive Maximum, because its guarantees depend on the session surviving a reconnect. On such a session a message that is acknowledged is processed exactly once; a message that is *rejected* is at-least-once, because per `[MQTT-4.3.3-9]` a receiver that sends an error acknowledgement must treat any later PUBLISH that reuses the Packet Identifier as a new Application Message, so a lost error acknowledgement followed by a reconnect replay is delivered again. Reject and delivery callbacks must therefore be idempotent. On a reconnect where the broker reports `session_present = 0` (a lost or expired session) the client clears its in-memory de-duplication state and re-sends its deferred-ack subscriptions, so a fresh session starts clean. Formally modelled and machine-checked in `specs/tla/deferred-ack/`. Addresses issues #108 and #110.

### Removed

- **BREAKING: removed the `mqtt5::tasks` module.** It exposed `packet_reader_task`, `keepalive_task`, and `handle_incoming_packet` — a parallel, skeletal client loop that predates `client::direct` and was never wired into the crate at any point in its history. It was public and callable, and was the crate's only public low-level packet-handling entry point, but it had drifted badly from the real implementation and was actively wrong: it delivered duplicate `QoS` 2 messages to the application, applied no inbound flow control (Receive Maximum was unenforced), never decoded payloads through the codec registry, never populated `stream_id`, and treated PINGRESP as a no-op so `keepalive_task` could never detect a dead peer. Keeping it would have meant maintaining a second copy of the crate's most delicate code with no users and no meaningful tests. Use `MqttClient`, which handles all of the above correctly.
- **BREAKING: removed `SessionState::store_pubrec`.** It is superseded by `SessionState::mark_pubrec_pending`, which performs the same insert and additionally reports whether the packet ID was already present. Its name was also ambiguous about direction — it read as "store the PUBREC we received" (outbound) while it meant "record the PUBREC we sent" (inbound).

### Fixed

- **The broker no longer sends a PUBREL after a subscriber rejects an outbound `QoS` 2 PUBLISH.** When a subscriber returned a PUBREC with a Reason Code of `0x80` or greater — rejecting the message — the broker ignored the Reason Code, stored the exchange as awaiting PUBCOMP, and sent a PUBREL anyway, leaving a half-open handshake on a Packet Identifier the subscriber considered finished. Per `[MQTT-4.3.3-4]` a PUBREL is sent only in response to a PUBREC with a Reason Code below `0x80`; an error PUBREC terminates the exchange. The broker now discards the in-flight message, frees the outbound quota, drains any queued messages, and sends no PUBREL. Covered by the conformance test `error_pubrec_from_subscriber_terminates_qos2_no_pubrel`.
- **`QoS` 1 and `QoS` 2 messages are now delivered to subscribers over QUIC.** Under the default per-topic delivery strategy the broker sends a PUBLISH on a server-initiated QUIC data flow, and per the MQoQ specification (§9.1.2) the subscriber's PUBACK/PUBREC must travel back on that same flow. The broker opened the flow as a bidirectional stream but discarded its receiving half, so the acknowledgement had nowhere to land: the subscriber's write failed, delivery was aborted before the application callback ran, and the stream was torn down — silently dropping every subsequent message on that topic, including `QoS` 0. The broker now reads the acknowledgements returned on each server data flow, so the `QoS` 1/2 handshake completes. `QoS` 0 delivery, which needs no acknowledgement, was unaffected.
- **An unreadable file in the storage directory no longer prevents the broker from starting.** Loading a stored item that could not be deserialized returned an error, which failed the retained-message load, which failed router initialization, which made `MqttBroker::run()` return before binding any listener. The broker was then unreachable on every transport with no indication why, and the only recovery was to find and delete the offending file by hand. Because the data in question is written by the broker itself, a single truncated file — from a crash, a full disk, or a partial write — was enough to make a broker permanently unstartable. Persisted state is now treated as untrusted input: a file that cannot be read is renamed with a `.corrupt` extension, reported, and skipped, so the remaining state still loads. This applies to every stored item (retained messages, sessions, queued messages, and inflight messages), and genuine I/O errors still propagate.
- **A configured QUIC listener that cannot bind now fails broker startup instead of being silently disabled.** `MqttBroker::with_config` warned and continued when a QUIC endpoint could not be bound, so the broker started with no QUIC listener and reported itself ready; clients then timed out with no indication why. A QUIC (or cluster QUIC) listener that is configured but binds no endpoint is now a startup error, matching how TCP listeners already behave.
- **Graceful shutdown now releases the QUIC port.** The broker dropped its QUIC endpoints on shutdown but did not close them, so while a client was still connected the underlying UDP socket stayed bound until its connections drained on their own. Restarting the broker on the same address could therefore fail to bind. Shutdown now closes each QUIC endpoint and waits for it to become idle before the accept task exits, so the address is free for an immediate rebind.
- **Concurrent writes to the same stored item can no longer corrupt it.** The temporary file used for an atomic write was named after its destination, so every writer of a given path shared one temporary file. One writer creating it truncated another's in-flight bytes, and the second writer then synced and renamed a zero-length or partial file into place; if the process stopped before its retry, the damage was permanent. This is how a zero-byte retained message could appear despite the write being flushed, synced, and renamed — the write was durable but not isolated. Temporary files are now unique per write, and are removed if the write or rename fails.
- **The client no longer delivers a duplicate `QoS` 2 PUBLISH to the application a second time.** On receiving a PUBLISH whose packet ID already had an outstanding PUBREC, the client re-ran the whole inbound path and dispatched the message to the application again, so the exactly-once guarantee of `[MQTT-4.3.3]` held on the wire but not at the application boundary. This surfaces whenever two PUBLISH packets for the same packet ID arrive before the handshake advances (for example a redelivery after a lost PUBREC, or a session-resume redelivery). Per §4.3.3 "Method A", the receiver must re-send PUBREC for a duplicate but must not re-deliver the Application Message; the client now records its inbound PUBREC state and delivers only on first receipt, while still re-sending PUBREC so the handshake completes. The check and the state update share a single write lock, so the guard also holds under QUIC, which runs one reader task per stream against a shared session. Reported in issue #112.
- **An outbound `QoS` 2 flow can no longer mask an inbound message and cause it to be dropped.** Inbound and outbound `QoS` 2 state shared one map keyed by packet ID, but MQTT packet IDs are independent per direction and both sides allocate from 1. A client that both published and subscribed at `QoS` 2 could therefore have an outbound PUBREL for packet ID *n* make a genuine inbound PUBLISH for packet ID *n* look like a duplicate, silently discarding a live message. Inbound PUBREC state is now tracked separately from outbound PUBREL state, and is cleared with the rest of the session state.
- **Inbound `QoS` 2 messages no longer leak into the outbound retransmission store.** The inbound path stored each received `QoS` 2 PUBLISH into the map used for outbound in-flight publishes, where nothing on the inbound path ever removed it, so every inbound `QoS` 2 message retained a full copy of its payload for the life of the session and was reported in `SessionStats::unacked_publish_count`. Because that map is also keyed by packet ID, an inbound message could overwrite a pending outbound publish with the same ID, and an outbound PUBACK/PUBREC could evict the inbound entry. The store served no purpose: delivery happens on first receipt, so the payload is never needed again. It has been removed.

### Changed

- `SessionStats::unacked_pubrel_count` now counts only outbound PUBRELs awaiting PUBCOMP. It previously also included inbound `QoS` 2 packet IDs awaiting PUBREL, because both shared one map.
- The `test_maximum_packet_size` integration test now configures the limit on the broker instead of the client. It had asserted that a client's own Maximum Packet Size restricts what that client may publish — the behaviour deliberately removed in mqtt5-protocol 0.14.2, since a client's Maximum Packet Size governs what it will *receive*. The test had been failing since that change and went unnoticed because the CI test step runs only `--lib --bins`. It now sets the broker's `max_packet_size`, which is what actually bounds an outbound PUBLISH, and asserts the publish fails with `PacketTooLarge`.

## [mqtt5 0.37.2] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- **The broker now includes the Subscription Identifier on retained messages delivered at subscribe time.** Previously, when a client subscribed with a Subscription Identifier to a topic that already had a retained message, the retained message was delivered without the identifier, because the retained-at-subscribe delivery path sent the stored PUBLISH straight to the client and bypassed the routing step that attaches the identifier to live publications. A retained message sent as the result of a matching subscription is a publication of that subscription, so per `[MQTT-3.3.4-3]` / §3.3.2.3.8 it must carry the subscription's Subscription Identifier; live delivery (publish-after-subscribe) already did. The identifier is now attached to each retained message before delivery, matching the live path and other brokers. Reported in issue #113.
- **The broker now downgrades the QoS of retained messages delivered at subscribe time to the subscription's granted QoS.** The same retained-at-subscribe delivery path that bypassed the Subscription Identifier step also skipped the QoS downgrade that live publications receive, so a retained `QoS` 1 message delivered to a `QoS` 0 subscription was sent at `QoS` 1, violating `[MQTT-3.8.4-8]` (the delivered `QoS` is the minimum of the message's `QoS` and the subscription's granted `QoS`). Retained delivery now applies the same `effective_qos` downgrade as the live path.

## [mqtt5 0.37.1] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- **The broker now fails startup when a configured bridge is invalid, instead of logging an error and starting anyway.** Previously an invalid bridge (for example one with no topic mappings) was reported at `ERROR` level and then silently dropped, leaving a broker that looked healthy but was not bridging. `BrokerConfig::validate` now validates every entry in `bridges` and rejects duplicate bridge names, so `MqttBroker::with_config` rejects an invalid or conflicting bridge before any listener binds, consistent with how every other broker subsystem (listeners, TLS, QUIC, storage, auth, cluster) fails fast on bad config. The same validation runs on the hot-reload path, so a reload carrying an invalid bridge is rejected and the previous configuration is retained (handled gracefully, no panic). Reported in discussion #102.

## [mqtt5 0.37.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- **`$SYS` topic publishing is now configurable via `BrokerConfig`.** Two new fields (with builders `with_sys_topics_enabled` and `with_sys_topics_interval`): `sys_topics_enabled` (default `true`) turns generation on or off entirely, and `sys_topics_interval` (default `10s`) sets the update cadence. When disabled, the broker skips starting the `$SYS` provider so no retained `$SYS` traffic is produced. Previously generation was always on with a hardcoded 10s interval, and the only lever was ACL to restrict reads.
- **The broker can now run without a plaintext TCP listener, enabling TLS-only (or WebSocket/QUIC-only) deployments.** Previously `bind_addresses` was mandatory, so a broker always bound plaintext MQTT. Clearing `bind_addresses` (e.g. `with_bind_addresses(Vec::new())`) now skips the plaintext listener; the broker binds only the transports you configure (`tls_config`, `websocket_config`, `websocket_tls_config`, `quic_config`). `with_config` validates that at least one client-facing listener exists and errors otherwise (inter-node cluster listeners do not count), so the broker can never start listening on nothing — including the case where a configured TLS/WS/QUIC port silently failed to bind. Default behavior is unchanged: the default `bind_addresses` still binds `0.0.0.0:1883` + `[::]:1883`.
- **`MqttBroker::tls_local_addr()`** returns the bound TLS listener address, mirroring the existing `local_addr()` and `ws_local_addr()`. Useful for connecting to a TLS-only broker bound to an ephemeral port.

## [mqtt5 0.36.1] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **The client now honors the broker's Maximum Packet Size advertised in CONNACK.** Previously the client only recorded its own inbound limit and ignored the server's, so an oversized PUBLISH was serialized and sent, the broker closed the connection per `[MQTT-3.2.2-15]`, and the failure surfaced to the application as a bare `NotConnected`. The client now records the server limit on connect and enforces it before sending, so an oversized publish fails locally with `PacketTooLarge { size, max }` (a distinct, non-recoverable error) instead of dropping the connection. The recorded server limit is also cleared when a later CONNACK omits the property, so a stale limit cannot persist across a reconnect or server redirect.
- A QoS 1/2 publish rejected by the packet-size check no longer consumes a packet identifier; the id is now allocated only after the size check passes, keeping the id sequence contiguous.
- A QoS 1/2 publish queued while disconnected (`queue_on_disconnect`) is now size-checked at enqueue time against the last negotiated maximum and rejected with `PacketTooLarge` before it is queued, instead of being acknowledged with `Ok` and then silently discarded. As a last-resort safety net for the rare case where the server advertises a smaller limit on reconnect (after the caller already received `Ok`), a still-oversized queued message is dropped with a warning when the queue is flushed rather than sent raw and dropping the reconnected connection.

### Added

- **`SessionState::reset_server_maximum_packet_size`** clears a previously recorded server Maximum Packet Size.

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.14.2] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **`LimitsManager::effective_maximum_packet_size` no longer clamps outbound packets by the client's own inbound limit.** An outbound PUBLISH is governed solely by the server's advertised Maximum Packet Size; the client's Maximum Packet Size is what it will *receive*, not what it may *send*. The effective maximum is now the server's advertised limit when present (falling back to the client limit only when the server advertises none), so a client that sets a small inbound limit no longer over-restricts its own publishes.

### Added

- **`LimitsManager::reset_server_maximum_packet_size`** clears a previously recorded server Maximum Packet Size.

### Changed

- Documented the semantics of `MqttError::classify` and `RecoverableError`: what "recoverable" means for the retry/backoff layer, and why precondition errors (`NotConnected`), permanent errors (auth/protocol), and AWS IoT connection-limit signals classify as non-recoverable. No behavior change.

## [mqtt5 0.36.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **`broker` cargo feature (enabled by default)** gating the entire broker implementation and its dependency tree (`argon2`, `regex`, `toml`, `hyper`, `hyper-rustls`, `hyper-util`, `http-body-util`). Client-only consumers can now build without the broker's dependencies via `mqtt5 = { version = "0.36", default-features = false }`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (only for `default-features = false` consumers): the broker is no longer compiled unless the `broker` feature is enabled.** Default builds are unaffected because `broker` is part of the default feature set; consumers who set `default-features = false` and use `mqtt5::broker` must add `features = ["broker"]`. The `turmoil-testing` feature now implies `broker`.

## [mqttv5-cli 0.28.2] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- Bumped the `mqtt5` dependency requirement to 0.36.

## [mqtt5-wasm 1.4.2] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- Bumped the `mqtt5` dependency requirement to 0.36; the crate's `broker` feature now enables `mqtt5/broker`.

## [mqtt5 0.35.1] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- Updated dependencies to their latest compatible versions: `bytes` 1.12, `rand` 0.10.2, `getrandom` 0.4.3, `quinn` 0.11.11, `rustls` 0.23.41, `rustls-pki-types` 1.15, `webpki-roots` 1.0.8, and dev-dependencies `anyhow`/`wasm-bindgen-test`. No API or behavior changes.

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.14.1] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- Updated `bytes` to 1.12. No API or behavior changes.

## [mqttv5-cli 0.28.1] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- Updated dependencies to their latest compatible versions: `anyhow` 1.0.103, `getrandom` 0.4.3, `humantime` 2.4, `time` 0.3.53, `quinn` 0.11.11, `rand` 0.10.2, `rustls` 0.23.41.

## [mqtt5-wasm 1.4.1] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- Updated dependencies to their latest compatible versions: `wasm-bindgen` 0.2.126, `wasm-bindgen-futures` 0.4.76, `js-sys`/`web-sys` 0.3.103, `getrandom` 0.4.3, `bytes` 1.12.

## [mqtt5 0.35.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- **`MqttBroker::shutdown_handle()` returns a cloneable `BrokerShutdownHandle`** - obtain the handle before moving the broker into `run()`, then call `handle.shutdown()` from a signal handler or any other task to make `run()` return after completing its graceful shutdown. This is the correct way to trigger shutdown of a running broker; the previous pattern of racing `run()` in a `tokio::select!` dropped the `run()` future without signaling it, leaving the `$SYS` publisher and transport accept loops running as detached tasks.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `MqttBroker::shutdown()` is now `fn shutdown(&self)` instead of `async fn shutdown(&self) -> Result<()>`** - it now only fires the internal shutdown signal, which is synchronous. The graceful teardown (aborting the `$SYS` task, stopping bridges, joining transport accept loops with a 5s timeout, flushing telemetry) moved into `run()`'s post-signal path, where the spawned tasks actually live. Callers using `broker.shutdown().await?` must drop the `.await` and `?`. The old method was effectively a no-op once `run()` had started, because `run()` had taken ownership of the shutdown sender.

## [mqtt5 0.34.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Inbound per-client rate and bandwidth limits are now configurable** - `BrokerConfig` gained `max_message_rate_per_client` (messages/sec) and `max_bandwidth_per_client` (bytes/sec), both defaulting to `0` (unlimited). These drive the broker's existing per-client inbound limiters, which were previously hardcoded "off" and unreachable from a config file. The values are hot-reloadable through the existing SIGHUP path. Adding these public fields to `BrokerConfig` (not `#[non_exhaustive]`) is technically breaking for code that constructs it with a struct literal; builder- and `Default`-based construction is unaffected.

### Changed

- **Inbound rate and bandwidth limits are now enforced independently** - `ResourceMonitor::can_send_message` previously short-circuited on `max_message_rate >= 1_000_000`, so the bandwidth limit silently did nothing unless message-rate limiting was also enabled. Each limit is now evaluated on its own (`0 = unlimited`), so `max_bandwidth_per_client` takes effect without also setting a message-rate cap. Default behavior is unchanged: both `0` takes the fast path with no per-message accounting.
- **SCRAM credential store no longer uses a poisoning lock** - `FileBasedScramCredentialStore` switched from `std::sync::RwLock` to `parking_lot::RwLock`, matching the rest of the broker and removing the poison-on-panic footgun on the authentication path. Internal; no public-API impact.

### Removed

- **BREAKING: removed the unenforced memory-limit API** - deleted `ResourceLimits.max_memory_bytes` (public field) and the `ResourceMonitor::get_memory_usage` / `ResourceMonitor::is_memory_limit_exceeded` methods. They were never wired into connection admission, and the estimate was a fixed `connections * 4096` that undercounted real usage; `max_clients` remains the deterministic bound on connection memory. Code referencing these items must drop those references.

## [mqtt5-wasm 1.4.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Inbound per-client rate and bandwidth limits are now configurable on the wasm broker** - the wasm `BrokerConfig` binding gained `maxMessageRatePerClient` (messages/sec) and `maxBandwidthPerClient` (bytes/sec) setters, both defaulting to `0` (unlimited). They drive the broker's per-client inbound limiter and are applied both on construction and through `updateConfig`, mirroring the new native `mqtt5` 0.34 `BrokerConfig` fields.

### Changed

- **Transitive bump: `mqtt5` 0.34** - picks up the configurable inbound rate/bandwidth limits and the removal of the unenforced memory-limit API. The wasm broker now wires these inbound limits through to its resource monitor; previously it always used the library defaults regardless of config.

## [mqttv5-cli 0.28.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **`generate-config` emits the new inbound limit keys** - the example config produced by `mqttv5 broker generate-config` now includes `max_message_rate_per_client` and `max_bandwidth_per_client` (both `0` = unlimited), matching the new `mqtt5` 0.34 `BrokerConfig` fields.

### Changed

- **Transitive bump: `mqtt5` 0.34** - no other CLI surface changes.

## [mqtt5 0.33.0] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **Broker config required every field to be present** - `BrokerConfig` derived `Deserialize` without a container-level `#[serde(default)]`, so a config file passed to `mqttv5 broker --config` failed to parse if it omitted any non-`Option`, non-defaulted field (e.g. `max_clients`), contradicting the per-field defaults documented in `CLI_USAGE.md`. Added `#[serde(default)]` to `BrokerConfig` and the nested `AuthConfig`, `RateLimitConfig`, `StorageConfig`, and `WebSocketConfig`, so omitted fields (including nested sub-fields) fall back to their `Default` impls. A minimal `{}` config is now valid (issue #85).

### Changed

- **BREAKING: SCRAM credential functions no longer expose `getrandom::Error`** - `ScramCredentials::from_password`, `ScramCredentials::from_password_with_iterations`, `generate_scram_credential_line`, and `generate_scram_credential_line_with_iterations` now return the crate's own `Result<_, MqttError>` (mapping salt-generation failure to `MqttError::Io`) instead of `std::result::Result<_, getrandom::Error>`. This removes the third-party error type from the public API so future `getrandom` bumps are no longer breaking. Callers matching on `getrandom::Error` must switch to `MqttError`; callers using `?` or `anyhow` are unaffected.
- **Bumped `mqtt5-protocol` dependency to 0.14** - pulls in the breaking `hashbrown` 0.17 change (see below).
- **Updated dependencies** - `getrandom` 0.3 → 0.4 (now an internal detail), `sha2` 0.10 → 0.11, `rand` 0.9 → 0.10 (the `random()` method moved to the new `RngExt` trait, updated internally), `toml` 0.9 → 1, `tokio-tungstenite` 0.28 → 0.29, and the OpenTelemetry stack (`opentelemetry`/`opentelemetry_sdk`/`opentelemetry-otlp` 0.31 → 0.32, `tracing-opentelemetry` 0.32 → 0.33). All internal; no further public-API impact.

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.14.0] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- **BREAKING: bumped `hashbrown` 0.16 → 0.17** - `SubscriptionManager::all()` returns `hashbrown::HashMap<String, Subscription>`, a public return type, so the crate-version change of `HashMap` is SemVer-breaking for consumers that name it.

## [mqtt5-wasm 1.3.3] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- **Transitive bump: `mqtt5` 0.33 and `mqtt5-protocol` 0.14** - no wasm surface changes; the breaking dependency changes are not re-exported through the wasm API. Also updates own dependencies `getrandom` 0.3 → 0.4, `sha2` 0.10 → 0.11, and `gloo-timers` 0.3 → 0.4.

## [mqttv5-cli 0.27.4] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- **Transitive bump: `mqtt5` 0.33** - picks up the config-file defaults fix (issue #85) end-to-end. Also updates own dependencies `rand` 0.9 → 0.10, `toml` 0.9 → 1, and `getrandom` 0.3 → 0.4. No CLI surface changes.

## [mqtt5 0.32.2] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- **Drop unmaintained `rustls-pemfile` dependency** - migrated all PEM parsing to `rustls-pki-types::pem::PemObject` (already implemented by `CertificateDer` and `PrivateKeyDer`). Closes [RUSTSEC-2025-0134](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0134.html). As a side effect, private-key loading now accepts PKCS#8, PKCS#1 (RSA), and SEC1 (EC) sections in one pass instead of three sequential format probes, and respects file order when multiple key types are present (issue #82, PR #83).

## [mqtt5 0.32.1] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **Broker ignored its own `ServerKeepAlive` override for read timeout** - when `BrokerConfig.server_keep_alive` was set, the broker wrote the overridden value into CONNACK ([MQTT-3.2.2-22]) but kept computing its read timeout (`keep_alive * 1.5`) from the client's *original* CONNECT value. A client requesting 600s against a broker configured for 1s would not be disconnected for ~900s. The broker now updates `self.keep_alive` at the same point as the CONNACK property write so read timeouts and the keep-alive enforcement interval both reflect the negotiated value. Also corrects `server_keep_alive = Some(0)`: previously the broker still enforced the client's non-zero interval; now the zero override actually disables broker-side enforcement (issue #80, PR #81).

## [mqttv5-cli 0.27.3] - 2026-05-16

### Changed

- **Bump `mqtt5` dep to `0.32`** - transitive bump for the breaking `ConnectionEvent::Connected` field addition. No CLI surface changes.

## [mqtt5-wasm 1.3.2] - 2026-05-16

### Changed

- **Bump `mqtt5` dep to `0.32` and `mqtt5-protocol` to `0.13`** - transitive bump for the breaking `ConnectionEvent::Connected` field addition. No wasm surface changes.

## [mqtt5 0.32.0] - 2026-05-16

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `ConnectionEvent::Connected` gained `keep_alive: Duration`** - exposes the broker-negotiated keep-alive interval from CONNACK to event consumers. Existing match arms that destructure the variant must be updated.

### Added

- **Honor MQTT v5 ServerKeepAlive negotiation** - the client now adopts the broker-supplied keep-alive interval from the CONNACK `Server Keep Alive` property when present ([MQTT-3.2.2-22]), driving PINGREQ cadence and read timeouts off the negotiated value rather than the requested one. The originally configured interval is preserved on `ConnectOptions::keep_alive` so subsequent CONNECTs re-negotiate from the user's intent. New `MqttClient::keep_alive() -> Duration` accessor exposes the current effective value.

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.13.0] - 2026-05-16

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `ConnectionEvent::Connected` variant gained `keep_alive: Duration`** - carries the broker-negotiated keep-alive interval out to event consumers. Adding a field to a public enum variant is a SemVer-major change.

### Added

- **`Properties::get_server_keep_alive() -> Option<u16>`** - getter for the v5 `ServerKeepAlive` CONNACK property, symmetric with the existing `set_server_keep_alive` setter.

## [mqtt5-wasm 1.3.1] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- **Retained message properties dropped (wasm broker)** - pulls in the `mqtt5 0.31.5` fix for issue #77. The wasm broker uses the same `broker::storage::RetainedMessage` as the native broker and shared the same v5-property loss on retained delivery to late subscribers; transitively fixed by the upstream change.

## [mqtt5 0.31.5] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- **Retained message properties dropped** - `response_topic`, `correlation_data`, `content_type`, `user_properties`, and `payload_format_indicator` were stripped when a retained message was stored and never restored on delivery to a late subscriber (issue #77). `broker::storage::RetainedMessage` had no fields for them; added the fields (each `#[serde(default)]` for file-backend back-compat) and routed extraction/restoration through a shared `V5PublishProps` helper now used by both `RetainedMessage` and `InflightMessage`.

### Deprecated

- **`session::retained::{RetainedMessage, RetainedMessageStore}` and `SessionState::{store_retained_message, get_retained_messages, retained_messages}`** - the session-level retained store is unused by the broker (the broker uses `broker::storage::RetainedMessage`). Scheduled for removal in 0.32.0.

## [mqttv5-cli 0.27.2] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **OTel ignored with --config** - OpenTelemetry env vars (`MQTT5_OTEL_ENDPOINT`, `MQTT5_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, `MQTT5_OTEL_SAMPLING`) were only applied in the CLI-args code path; when using `--config <file>`, the OTel setup was skipped entirely because `opentelemetry_config` is `#[serde(skip)]` and the env var merge lived inside `create_interactive_config()`. Moved OTel initialization to `execute_run()` so it applies regardless of config source.

## [mqtt5 0.31.4] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- **WSS ALPN mismatch** - WebSocket TLS listener now advertises `http/1.1` ALPN instead of `mqtt`, allowing browsers to complete the TLS handshake on the WSS port

## [mqtt5 0.31.3] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- **Conformance test fixes** - fix 9 conformance test failures verified against Mosquitto (test parsing bug, spec ambiguity adjustments)
- **QUIC integration test hardening** - replace ad-hoc sleeps with `ready_receiver()`, fix port conflicts, add graceful connection failure handling
- **Conformance platform** - vendor-neutral conformance test platform with `#[conformance_test]` proc-macro and CLI runner supporting in-process and external SUT testing
- **FileBackend deadlock** - fix `get_session()` deadlock caused by Rust 2021 `if let` temporary lifetime holding read guard across write lock

## [mqtt5 0.31.2] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- **Reconnect lifecycle hardening** - connection epoch guards prevent stale keepalive/reader tasks from disconnecting newer connections; QUIC close frame now carries semantic reason (`reconnect` vs `disconnect`); subscription restore no longer duplicates on reconnect
- **Epoch and pending-channel helpers consolidated** - `owns_current_connection` and `mark_disconnected_if_current` moved to single source in keepalive module; `clear_pending_if_current` inlined into `PacketReaderContext`

## [mqttv5-cli 0.27.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Environment variable support for all CLI flags** - Every flag on `broker`, `pub`, and `sub` subcommands can now be set via `MQTT5_` prefixed environment variables (e.g., `MQTT5_HOST`, `MQTT5_TLS_CERT`, `MQTT5_NON_INTERACTIVE`). CLI flags take precedence over env vars. Broker bind addresses use `MQTT5_BIND`, `MQTT5_TLS_BIND`, `MQTT5_WS_BIND`, `MQTT5_WS_TLS_BIND`, and `MQTT5_QUIC_BIND` to avoid collision with the client `MQTT5_HOST` (hostname). Repeatable flags accept comma-separated values from env vars. Dockerfile sets `MQTT5_NON_INTERACTIVE=true` by default.

## [mqtt5 0.31.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- **OpenTelemetry span instrumentation** - distributed tracing spans across broker hot paths behind `#[cfg(feature = "opentelemetry")]`: connect, disconnect, publish, subscribe, unsubscribe, QoS handshake (puback/pubrec/pubrel/pubcomp), will message, route, deliver (regular and shared subscriptions), and bridge forward
- **OpenTelemetry metrics bridge** - `MetricsBridge` registers 10 observable instruments (clients connected/total/maximum, messages sent/received, publish sent/received, bytes sent/received, uptime) that read `BrokerStats` atomics via OTLP periodic export
- **Telemetry provider lifecycle** - `OnceLock`-stored `SdkTracerProvider` and `SdkMeterProvider` with `shutdown_telemetry()` that flushes and shuts down both providers on broker shutdown
- `TelemetryConfig::with_metrics_enabled()` builder method and `init_meter_provider()` for OTLP metric export setup

## [mqtt5 0.30.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Optional transport features** - QUIC and WebSocket transports are now behind cargo feature flags (`transport-quic`, `transport-websocket`), both enabled by default for backward compatibility
  - `cargo add mqtt5 --no-default-features` gives TCP/TLS only, with no quinn or tungstenite dependencies
  - Modules gated at declaration site — disabled transports simply don't exist rather than providing stubs
  - Clear compile-time errors when attempting to use a disabled transport (e.g., `ws://` URL without `transport-websocket`)
  - Broker rejects config requesting disabled transports with descriptive error messages

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.12.0] / [mqtt5 0.29.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **QUIC error code enums** - `QuicConnectionCode` (5 variants) and `QuicStreamCode` (16 variants) for typed QUIC APPLICATION_CLOSE and RESET_STREAM codes per MQTT-next §12
- **Error tolerance levels** - `handle_stream_error()` implements graduated response based on `FlowFlags.err_tolerance` per MQTT-next §11: Level 0 closes connection, Level 1 resets stream and discards flow, Level 2 resets stream but preserves flow state for recovery
- **Quinn error parsing** - `QuicCloseReason`, `StreamResetReason`, `StreamStopReason` enums with `parse_connection_error()`, `parse_read_error()`, `parse_write_error()` for structured QUIC error diagnostics
- **STOP_SENDING on data stream errors** - Broker sends STOP_SENDING with `IncompletePacket` code when a data stream read fails
- 7 new `ReasonCode` variants: `MqoqPersistentTopic`, `MqoqOptionalHeader`, `MqoqFlowPacketCancelled`, `MqoqFlowRefused`, `MqoqDiscardState`, `MqoqServerPushNotWelcome`, `MqoqRecoveryFailed`
- `ReasonCode::to_quic_stream_code()` and `ReasonCode::from_quic_stream_code()` conversions

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `MqoqProtocolError` renamed to `MqoqNotFlowOwner`** to match spec naming
- All `conn.close()` and `send.reset()` calls now use typed error codes instead of hard-coded `0u32` / `0xC1`

## [mqtt5 0.28.0] / [mqttv5-cli 0.25.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **QUIC 0-RTT connection resumption** - Reconnecting clients can skip the TLS handshake round trip per MQTT-next §8.1
  - Broker `enable_early_data` config sets `max_early_data_size` and `send_half_rtt_data` on rustls `ServerConfig`
  - Client caches `quinn::ClientConfig` (session ticket store) across reconnections for `Connecting::into_0rtt()`
  - Automatic 1-RTT fallback when no session ticket exists or server rejects early data
  - `MqttClient::was_zero_rtt()` reports whether the current connection used 0-RTT
  - `--quic-early-data` CLI flag on broker, pub, sub, and bench commands

## [mqtt5 0.27.0] / [mqttv5-cli 0.24.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Discard flow state at peer** - Client can force the broker to discard flow state per MQoQ §9.16
  - `MqttClient::discard_flow(flow_id)` opens bidirectional QUIC stream with `clean_start=1` and all persistent flags cleared
  - Broker `accept_bi` loop dispatches to `spawn_discard_handler` which validates the discard signal, removes the flow from `FlowRegistry`, and responds with FIN
  - `FlowFlags::is_discard_signal()` and `FlowFlags::discard()` for detecting and constructing discard signals
  - Non-discard bidirectional streams are reset with error code `0xC1` (`ERROR_NO_FLOW_STATE`)

### Changed

- Refactored `run_quic_handler_inner` into `spawn_datagram_reader`, `spawn_bi_accept_loop`, `spawn_uni_accept_loop` helpers

## [mqtt5 0.26.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **ALPN negotiation for MQTT-next** - Client and broker negotiate `MQTT-next` vs `mqtt` ALPN per MQoQ §7.4
  - Broker advertises both `MQTT-next` and `mqtt` ALPNs; clients requesting Advanced Multistreams get `MQTT-next`
  - Client offers `["MQTT-next", "mqtt"]` when `enable_flow_headers` is true, `["mqtt"]` otherwise
  - Negotiated ALPN read from `HandshakeData` after QUIC handshake; downgrade logged as warning
  - Flow headers gated on successful `MQTT-next` negotiation — never sent to peers that didn't negotiate it

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `QuicTransport::into_split()` return type** - Returns `QuicSplitResult` struct instead of 6-element tuple
- **`QuicStreamManager` now configured with flow header state** from `QuicSplitResult` (flow_headers, flow_expire_interval, flow_flags)

## [mqtt5 0.25.0] / [mqttv5-cli 0.23.0] / [mqtt5-wasm 1.3.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **QUIC connection migration** - Client and server support for seamless network address changes
  - `MqttClient::migrate()` triggers connection migration via `Endpoint::rebind()` to a new UDP socket
  - Server-side detection via `ClientHandler::check_quic_migration()` polling `Connection::remote_address()` after each packet
  - `ResourceMonitor::update_connection_ip()` atomically transitions per-IP connection tracking
  - All streams, subscriptions, and sessions survive migration transparently
  - Non-QUIC transports return a descriptive error; not-connected state returns `NotConnected`

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.11.0] / [mqtt5 0.24.0] / [mqttv5-cli 0.22.0] / [mqtt5-wasm 1.2.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Server redirect via CONNACK** - Load balancer support using MQTT v5.0 `UseAnotherServer` (0x9C) reason code
  - `LoadBalancerConfig` with consistent-hash backend selection based on client ID
  - `BrokerConfig::with_load_balancer()` and `--load-balancer-backend` CLI flag (repeatable)
  - Client automatically follows up to 3 redirect hops
  - Both `UseAnotherServer` and `ServerMoved` (0x9D) reason codes handled
  - WASM broker support via `addLoadBalancerBackend()`/`clearLoadBalancerBackends()` on `BrokerConfig`
  - WASM client returns structured `{type: "redirect", url: "..."}` error for application-level handling
  - `MqttError::UseAnotherServer` variant for clean redirect error propagation
  - TLS redirect preserves CA certificate configuration across redirect hops
  - Empty client IDs distribute across backends via monotonic counter (not static hash)

### Fixed

- **`select_backend` panic on empty backends** - Returns `Option<&str>` instead of indexing empty vec

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.10.0] / [mqtt5 0.23.0] / [mqttv5-cli 0.21.0] / [mqtt5-wasm 1.1.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Per-client outbound rate limiting** - `max_outbound_rate_per_client` config limits messages/second delivered to each subscriber; hot-reloadable via SIGHUP (native) and config change (WASM)
- **`PublishAction` event hooks** - `on_client_publish` now returns `PublishAction` (`Continue`, `Handled`, `Transform`) for intercepting and modifying publishes before routing
- **`ServerDeliveryStrategy` config** - Broker-side QUIC delivery strategy (`ControlOnly`, `PerTopic`, `PerPublish`) replaces client-driven stream strategy for server-to-client data paths
- **Datagram type discrimination** - QUIC datagram receiver distinguishes MQTT packets from non-MQTT datagrams instead of treating all as errors
- **Unidirectional QUIC streams** - Data streams changed from bidirectional to unidirectional for server-to-client delivery, reducing resource overhead
- **QUIC flow control tuning** - Configurable stream receive window (256KB), connection receive window (1MB), and send window (1MB)
- **Stale subscription cleanup** - Router periodically removes subscriptions for disconnected clients during storage cleanup cycle
- **`--quic-delivery-strategy` CLI flag** - Broker CLI option to set server delivery strategy
- **`--trace-dir` bench flag** - Per-message trace CSV output for latency analysis with topic, sequence, stream ID, and timing columns
- **Bench HOL blocking metrics** - `inter_topic_spread`, `detrended_correlation`, `spike_isolation_ratio`, and `inter_arrival_cluster_ratio` metrics in HOL mode JSON output
- **Bench payload sequence numbers** - Raw payload format now encodes a 4-byte sequence number at offset 8 for message ordering analysis
- **WebSocket bridge support** - WASM broker `addBridgeWebSocket()` and `BridgeConnection.connect_ws()` for WebSocket-based bridge connections

### Changed

- **BREAKING: `PublishPacket.stream_id`** - New `stream_id: Option<u64>` field on `PublishPacket` and `Message` (mqtt5-protocol)
- **BREAKING: `on_client_publish` return type** - Changed from `Pin<Box<Future<Output = ()>>>` to `Pin<Box<Future<Output = PublishAction>>>`
- **BREAKING: `QuicStreamManager::open_data_stream`** - Returns `SendStream` instead of `(SendStream, RecvStream)` (unidirectional streams)
- **`DataPerSubscription` deprecated** - Client-side `StreamStrategy::DataPerSubscription` marked deprecated; use `ServerDeliveryStrategy::PerTopic` instead
- **`BrokerConfig` new fields** - `max_outbound_rate_per_client: u32` and `server_delivery_strategy: ServerDeliveryStrategy` added with defaults

### Fixed

- **File backend queue filename collision** - Queue filenames now use a global atomic sequence counter instead of `timestamp % 1_000_000`, preventing overwrites when multiple messages are queued in the same millisecond

## [mqtt5-wasm 1.0.0] - 2026-03-02

### Changed

- **BREAKING: camelCase JS API** - All exported types, methods, properties, and parameter names now follow JavaScript conventions
  - Types: `WasmBroker` → `Broker`, `WasmMqttClient` → `MqttClient`, `WasmBrokerConfig` → `BrokerConfig`, etc.
  - Methods: `connect_with_options` → `connectWithOptions`, `subscribe_with_callback` → `subscribeWithCallback`, etc.
  - Properties: `config.max_clients` → `config.maxClients`, `config.allow_anonymous` → `config.allowAnonymous`, etc.
  - See [MIGRATION-1.0.md](crates/mqtt5-wasm/MIGRATION-1.0.md) for the complete rename mapping

## [mqtt5 0.22.10] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.11] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.7] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Server-side per-topic QUIC stream delivery** - Broker routes publishes to topic-specific QUIC streams via `ServerStreamManager`, enabling independent multiplexing per topic
- **Bench tool `--payload-format` flag** - Compare serialization overhead with raw, json, bebytes, and compressed-json payload formats
- **Bench tool HOL-blocking mode improvements** - Rate-limited publishing (`--rate`) for clean inter-topic correlation measurement
- **SSH keepalive in experiment scripts** - Prevents SSH timeout on long-running remote bench sessions

### Changed

- **QUIC client endpoint lifecycle** - `into_split()` returns the endpoint; disconnect uses `wait_idle` with timeout instead of fixed sleep, adapting to actual RTT
- **Experiment infrastructure** - Bench connections use stable internal VPC IP; SSH/SCP use external IP separately

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.9.9] / [mqtt5 0.22.9] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.10] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.6] / [mqtt5-conformance 0.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **mqtt5-conformance crate** - MQTT v5.0 OASIS specification conformance test suite
  - 197 tests across 22 test files covering sections 1, 3, 4, and 6
  - Tracks all 247 normative `[MQTT-x.x.x-y]` statements in a structured TOML manifest

- **`Properties::get_maximum_packet_size()`** - Property accessor for Maximum Packet Size

### Fixed

- **DUP flag propagation** - Router no longer propagates publisher's DUP flag to subscribers; resets to false before forwarding [MQTT-3.3.1-1]
- **PUBCOMP reason codes** - PUBCOMP now returns `PacketIdentifierNotFound` when PUBREL arrives for non-existent packet ID instead of always sending Success [MQTT-3.7.2-1]
- **Will message suppression** - DISCONNECT with reason code 0x04 (`DisconnectWithWillMessage`) now correctly preserves the will message [MQTT-3.14.4-3]
- **Queued message drain data loss** - Messages are no longer removed from storage before successful transmission; unsent messages are re-queued
- **WASM UNSUBACK reason codes** - WASM broker now returns `NoSubscriptionExisted` when unsubscribing from non-existent subscription [MQTT-3.11.3-1]
- **CONNACK v3.1.1 construction** - Fixed CONNACK packet builder to use protocol-version-aware encoding for v3.1.1 clients
- **DUP+QoS0 rejection** - Reject PUBLISH with DUP=1 and QoS=0 as malformed [MQTT-3.3.1-2]
- **Will QoS validation** - Reject CONNECT when Will QoS exceeds server maximum via CONNACK 0x9A [MQTT-3.2.2-11]

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.9.8] / [mqtt5 0.22.8] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.9] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.5] - 2026-02-16

### Security

- **Max packet size enforcement** - Enforce max packet size before buffer allocation in all packet read paths (native + WASM), preventing OOM from malicious remaining-length fields
- **CompositeAuthProvider authorization modes** - `AuthorizationMode` enum (`PrimaryOnly`/`Or`/`And`) with safe `PrimaryOnly` default — fallback provider no longer silently grants access
- **Read timeouts** - Added read timeouts to `handle_packets` (keepalive × 1.5) and `handle_packets_no_keepalive` (300s zombie guard) to prevent idle connection resource exhaustion
- **Decompression bomb limits** - `max_decompressed_size` (default 10MB) on all 4 codec structs (native gzip/deflate, WASM gzip/deflate) to block decompression bombs
- **Per-username rate limiting** - Auth rate limiter now tracks both IP and username, blocking credential stuffing attacks that rotate source IPs
- **ConnectPacket password redaction** - `ConnectPacket` and `ConnectOptions` (mqtt5-protocol) now use custom `Debug` impls that print `[REDACTED]` instead of raw password bytes, preventing credential leakage via `{:?}` formatting
- **EnhancedAuthResult auth_data redaction** - `EnhancedAuthResult` now uses a custom `Debug` impl that prints `<N bytes>` instead of raw authentication exchange data (SCRAM challenges, JWT tokens)
- **QUIC packet debug log sanitized** - QUIC data stream reader now logs only the packet type name at `debug!` level instead of the full packet contents, preventing payload and credential exposure in debug logs
- **Password file parse error log sanitized** - Malformed password/certificate file lines are no longer included in warning log messages, preventing accidental exposure of hashes or secrets on format errors

### Added

- **`Packet::packet_type_name()`** - Returns the MQTT packet type as a static string (e.g., `"CONNECT"`, `"PUBLISH"`) for safe logging without exposing packet contents

### Changed

- **WASM reconnect defaults** - `max_attempts` defaults to 20 (was unlimited); WebSocket URL scheme validated; warning logged for credentials over `ws://`
- **Resource monitor locks** - Switched to `parking_lot::RwLock` (no lock poisoning)
- **ALPN protocol validation** - Invalid ALPN protocols are filtered with a warning instead of panicking

## [mqtt5 0.22.7] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- **File backend atomic write race** - Fixed race condition where concurrent `remove_dir_all` could delete the temp file between write and rename, causing ENOENT errors when queuing messages for offline clients

## [mqtt5 0.22.6] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.8] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- **Browser connectivity detection** - WASM client detects browser online/offline state during reconnection
  - `on_connectivity_change(callback)` fires when the browser goes online or offline
  - `is_browser_online()` returns current network state synchronously
  - Reconnection pauses while offline (no wasted retries) and resumes immediately when network returns
  - Backoff resets after a network outage since the failure was connectivity, not server rejection
- **Connectivity detection example** - New `connectivity-detection` example demonstrating online/offline handling

### Fixed

- **Flaky session security tests** - Replaced millisecond-precision timestamps with atomic counter for temp file naming, preventing filename collisions when concurrent tests execute within the same millisecond
- **Release workflow artifacts** - Fixed GitHub Actions release workflow to correctly flatten artifact directories before uploading to the release

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.9.7] / [mqtt5 0.22.5] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.6] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.4] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **`x-mqtt-client-id` injection** - Broker injects publisher's MQTT client_id as `x-mqtt-client-id` user property on every PUBLISH (strips client-supplied values first to prevent spoofing). Applies to normal publishes, will messages, and bridge paths in both native and WASM brokers
- **Echo suppression** - Configurable delivery suppression when a user property value matches the subscriber's client_id
  - `EchoSuppressionConfig` with `enabled` and `property_key` (default `x-origin-client-id`)
  - Defaults to `x-origin-client-id` (not `x-mqtt-client-id`) because intermediaries like MQDB republish with their own client_id — only the application-layer origin property tracks the real causation chain
  - Hot-reloadable via SIGHUP (native) and `update_config()` (WASM)
  - `BrokerConfig::with_echo_suppression()` and `WasmBrokerConfig` setters
- **`Properties::get_user_property_value()`** - Single-value user property lookup by key

### Changed

- Router construction extracted to `MqttBroker::build_router()` for reuse between init and reload paths

### Fixed

- **CLI TLS broker tests** use `--storage-backend memory` instead of default file backend, preventing failures from stale/corrupt storage left by prior runs

## [mqtt5 0.22.4] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.5] - 2026-02-10

### Security

- **JWT exp claim enforcement** - Tokens without `exp` (expiration) claim are now rejected instead of being treated as never-expiring. Applies to both `JwtAuthProvider` and `FederatedJwtAuthProvider`
- **JWT sub claim enforcement** - Tokens without `sub` (subject) claim are now rejected instead of defaulting to empty string identity
- **JWT algorithm confusion prevention** - Verifier selection now uses `kid` (key ID) header matching instead of trusting the `alg` header from untrusted tokens. Single-verifier configurations ignore the header algorithm entirely
- **Session-to-user binding** - Sessions now store the authenticated `user_id`. On reconnect with `clean_start=false`, the broker rejects the connection if the reconnecting user doesn't match the session owner
- **ACL re-check on session restore** - When restoring subscriptions from a previous session, each topic filter is re-authorized against current ACL rules. Subscriptions that no longer pass authorization are pruned
- **Certificate auth transport guard** - `cert:` prefixed client IDs are now rejected at the transport layer unless the connection has a verified TLS client certificate. Prevents spoofing certificate identity over plain TCP, WebSocket, or QUIC connections
- **Certificate auth fingerprint validation** - `CertificateAuthProvider` now validates TLS peer certificate fingerprints against registered fingerprints instead of trusting `cert:` prefix in client IDs. Fingerprints must be exactly 64 hex characters
- **SCRAM state collision fix** - SCRAM authentication now rejects concurrent authentication attempts for the same `client_id`, preventing auth state from being clobbered
- **QUIC bridge TLS verification** - QUIC bridges now default to certificate verification enabled (`secure: true`), matching QUIC's mandatory TLS requirement
- **WebSocket path enforcement** - Requests to non-configured WebSocket paths now return HTTP 404 instead of silently accepting the connection
- **WebSocket Origin validation** - New `allowed_origins` configuration on `WebSocketServerConfig` for Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) prevention. When set, connections without a matching `Origin` header are rejected with HTTP 403
- **Bridge config password redaction** - `BridgeConfig` Debug output now prints `[REDACTED]` instead of the plaintext password
- **Password field redaction in logs** - Auth provider tracing instrumentation now skips password fields to prevent credential leakage in logs
- **NoVerification struct restricted** - `NoVerification` (TLS certificate bypass) changed from `pub` to `pub(crate)` to prevent accidental misuse by downstream crates
- **Topic name validation on publish** - Broker now validates topic names on incoming PUBLISH packets after topic alias resolution, rejecting invalid topics before routing
- **Topic filename bijective encoding** - File storage backend replaced `_slash_` topic-to-filename encoding with percent-encoding (`/` → `%2F`, `%` → `%25`), preventing collisions between topics like `a/b` and `a_slash_b`
- **fsync for file storage durability** - Atomic file writes now call `sync_data()` before rename, ensuring data reaches disk before the old file is replaced
- **SCRAM password zeroization** - Client-side SCRAM password storage now uses `Zeroizing<String>` which automatically zeros memory on drop
- **Regex compilation caching** - JWT claim pattern regexes are now compiled once at deserialization time instead of on every authentication attempt. Invalid regex patterns fail at config load
- **innerHTML XSS prevention** - All 19 WASM example HTML files replaced `innerHTML +=` with safe DOM manipulation (`createElement` + `textContent` + `appendChild`)
- **WASM enhanced auth user_id propagation** - Fixed missing `user_id` capture in WASM broker's enhanced auth success path
- **Packet ID collision prevention** - After restoring inflight messages on reconnect, the broker now scans both `outbound_inflight` and `inflight_publishes` maps to advance the packet ID counter past any occupied IDs, preventing collisions in both native and WASM brokers
- **Session user binding hardened** - Anonymous-to-authenticated and authenticated-to-anonymous session mismatches are now correctly rejected (previously only authenticated-to-different-authenticated was caught)

### Fixed

- **InflightMessage expiry survives serialization** - Replaced `#[serde(skip)]` `expires_at` with serializable `expires_at_secs` (epoch seconds) plus an in-memory cache, so expiry is preserved across file backend round-trips

### Changed

- **MemoryBackend inflight storage** - Inflight messages now stored in `HashMap<(u16, InflightDirection), InflightMessage>` per client instead of `Vec<InflightMessage>`, giving O(1) insert/remove/lookup instead of O(n) linear scan

## [mqtt5 0.22.3] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.5] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **QoS 2 inflight persistence** - Broker persists in-flight QoS 2 messages across client reconnections
  - `InflightMessage` struct stores decomposed publish data with direction (Inbound/Outbound) and phase (AwaitingPubrec/AwaitingPubrel/AwaitingPubcomp)
  - `StorageBackend` trait extended with `store_inflight_message`, `get_inflight_messages`, `remove_inflight_message`, `remove_all_inflight_messages`
  - `MemoryBackend` and `FileBackend` implementations for inflight storage
  - On reconnect with `clean_start=false`, broker resends outbound PUBLISH (DUP=1) or PUBREL and restores inbound inflight state
  - `clean_start=true` clears all inflight messages
  - Message expiry tracking for inflight messages with automatic cleanup
  - Applies to both native and WASM brokers

- **WASM outbound inflight tracking** - WASM broker now tracks outbound QoS 2 messages
  - Assigns packet IDs and persists outbound inflight state in the forward loop
  - `handle_pubrec`/`handle_pubcomp` update and remove inflight storage
  - `resend_inflight_messages` on session restore

- **QoS 2 recovery demo** (`examples/qos2-recovery/`) - Interactive browser demo showing QoS 2 mid-flight recovery after connection interruption

## [mqtt5 0.22.2] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.4] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Missing `user_id` in enhanced auth success paths** - JWT-authenticated clients now correctly propagate identity downstream
  - Enhanced auth (JWT) success paths never captured `result.user_id` into `self.user_id`, so `inject_sender()` inserted `None` for JWT clients
  - Fixes immediate enhanced auth success, multi-step Continue→Success, and re-authentication success
  - Password auth was unaffected (already captured `user_id` correctly)

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.9.5] / [mqtt5 0.22.1] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.3] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.3] - 2026-02-01

### Security

- **Will message ACL enforcement** - Will messages now checked against ACL at publish time
  - Previously, will messages bypassed `authorize_publish()` entirely, allowing any authenticated client to publish to any topic by setting it as their will topic and disconnecting abnormally
  - All three will paths enforced: immediate (no delay), immediate (delay=0), and delayed (delay>0)
  - Delayed wills re-check ACL after the delay timer, catching rule changes between connect and disconnect
  - Applies to both native and WASM brokers

- **`x-mqtt-sender` identity injection** - Broker injects authenticated username as `x-mqtt-sender` user property on all PUBLISH packets
  - Strips any client-supplied `x-mqtt-sender` properties before injecting the real identity
  - Applies to both normal publishes and will messages
  - Prevents sender identity spoofing

- **`%u` ACL substitution hardened against wildcard injection** - Rejects usernames containing `+`, `#`, or `/` characters
  - Without this, a username like `+` would expand `$DB/u/%u/#` into `$DB/u/+/#`, matching all users' namespaces

### Added

- **`%u` ACL pattern substitution** - ACL topic patterns can use `%u` as a placeholder for the authenticated username
  - Enables per-user topic namespacing: `user * topic $DB/u/%u/# permission readwrite`
  - Works in both direct ACL rules and role-based rules
  - Anonymous clients never match `%u` patterns

- **Will message property forwarding** - Will messages now carry all MQTT v5 properties set at connect time
  - `payload_format_indicator`, `message_expiry_interval`, `content_type`, `response_topic`, `correlation_data`, and user properties
  - `WillProperties::apply_to_publish_properties()` helper on mqtt5-protocol

- **ACL management helpers** - Runtime ACL rule management
  - `AclManager::list_rules()`, `list_user_rules()`, `remove_rule()`
  - `PasswordAuthProvider::list_users()`

- **`ClientPublishEvent.user_id`** - Publish event now includes the authenticated user identity for event handlers

### Fixed

- **WASM transport Drop impls** - `BroadcastChannelWriter`, `MessagePortWriter`, and `WasmWriter` now properly clean up event handlers and close connections on drop
  - Prevents closure-after-drop panics in WASM environments

- **WASM WebSocket recursive mutex panic** - Replaced `Arc<Mutex<Option<oneshot::Sender>>>` with `Rc<Cell<Option<oneshot::Sender>>>` in WebSocket connect
  - The JS `onopen`/`onerror` callbacks run synchronously on the same thread, making `Mutex` prone to recursive locking

### Changed

- **`disconnect()` returns `Err(NotConnected)` when not connected** - Previously returned `Ok(())`
  - Callers that need the old behavior can match on `Err(MqttError::NotConnected)`

- **`build_will_properties` simplified** - Uses `WillProperties::into()` conversion instead of manual property-by-property construction

## [mqtt5 0.22.0] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.2] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.2] - 2026-01-27

### Added

- **CompositeAuthProvider** - Chains a primary auth provider with a fallback; falls through to fallback on `BadAuthenticationMethod`, enabling mixed enhanced/password auth
- **`MqttBroker::auth_provider()`** - Getter to extract the broker's built auth provider for wrapping with `CompositeAuthProvider`

## [mqtt5-protocol 0.9.4] / [mqtt5 0.21.1] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.1] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.1] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- **Invalid packet_id initialization** - `PublishPacket::new` no longer sets packet_id to 0 for QoS > 0 (0 is not a valid MQTT packet identifier)

### Added

- Debug tracing for outgoing PUBLISH packets and retained message delivery

## [mqtt5 0.21.0] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.10.0] / [mqttv5-cli 0.20.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added

- **Change-only delivery** - Broker-configured duplicate payload suppression
  - Only delivers messages when payload differs from last delivered value per topic per subscriber
  - Configured via `ChangeOnlyDeliveryConfig` with topic patterns (e.g., `sensors/#`)
  - Reduces bandwidth for topics that frequently publish unchanged values
  - State persists across client reconnections
  - WASM support: `set_change_only_delivery_enabled`, `add_change_only_delivery_pattern`
  - New example: `change-only-delivery/`

### Changed

- **WASM bridge loop prevention disabled by default** - TTL changed from 60s to 0 (disabled)
  - Prevents unexpected behavior for users who don't need loop prevention
  - Enable explicitly with `set_loop_prevention_ttl_secs(60)` if needed

- Internal dependency management: mqtt5 crate now uses workspace `[patch.crates-io]`

## [mqtt5 0.20.0] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.9.0] / [mqttv5-cli 0.19.0] - 2026-01-19

  - Compression now works with default 1MB WASM stack

### Changed

- Bridge configuration now uses wasm-bindgen setters for JavaScript property access
- WASM broker connection stability improvements

  - Callers must remove `.await` from these function calls

- **Parameter type changes**: Some functions now take `&str` instead of `String`
  - `CallbackManager::register` and `register_with_id`: `topic_filter: &str`
  - `CertificateAuthProvider::add_certificate`: `fingerprint: &str, username: &str`

- **Disconnect behavior**: `MqttClient::disconnect()` now returns `Ok(())` when not connected
  - Previously returned `Err(MqttError::NotConnected)`
  - Now treats disconnect on disconnected client as a no-op for simpler cleanup code

## [mqtt5 0.18.3] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.8.3] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- **Lifecycle event callbacks for WASM broker**: JavaScript callbacks for broker activity monitoring
  - `on_client_connect(callback)`: Fires when client connects with `{clientId, cleanStart}`

- **Priority keepalive mechanism**: Keepalive uses try_lock with retry for shared state access
  - Falls back to spawned task if lock contention detected
  - Ensures keepalive pings are sent even during heavy publish activity

## [mqttv5-cli 0.18.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added

- **Human-readable duration parsing**: All duration CLI flags now accept humantime formats
  - Supports: `30s`, `5m`, `1h`, `1m30s`, `500ms` in addition to raw numbers
  - Applies to: `--timeout`, `--keep-alive`, `--session-expiry`, `--will-delay`, `--delay`, `--interval`
  - Backward compatible: raw numbers interpreted as seconds (except `--interval` which uses milliseconds)

- **`--delay` flag for pub command**: Delay before publishing the first message
  - Example: `mqttv5 pub -t test -m hello --delay 5s`

- **`--repeat` and `--interval` flags for pub command**: Repeated message publishing

  - Auto-rolls to tomorrow if time-of-day already passed
  - Conflicts with `--delay` (mutually exclusive)

## [0.18.1] / [mqtt5-wasm 0.8.1] / [mqttv5-cli 0.17.1] - 2026-01-07

  - Set `fallback_tcp: true` instead of manually adding `Tcp` to `fallback_protocols`
  - TCP is appended to fallback list only if not already present

- **`connection_retries` for bridge connections**: Retry primary protocol before falling back
  - Default: 3 retries with 1 second delay between attempts
  - Only falls back to secondary protocols after all retries exhausted

### Changed

**Note**: This project was originally created as a showcase for the BeBytes derive macro capabilities,
demonstrating serialization in real-world MQTT applications. It has evolved into
a full-featured MQTT v5.0 platform with both client and broker implementations,
complete with a unified CLI tool.
